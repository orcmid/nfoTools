**2024-11-09 Status**: Software releases from the nfoTools project are
intended primarily for use by software developers and provided as open-source
available for inspection and understanding by developers.  Some materials are
intended to support novices and those wanting to dig deeper into software
development.

While there is generally no code that would be installed for end-users, there
are potentially "supply-chain" risks that might emerge with the use of an
nfoTool dependency in a down-stream development.

Although there are no such cases at this time, these security provisions are
in place as a precaution against eventualities where threat surface exposures
might arise.

## Supported Versions

Most considerations of errors and defects can be handled using the project
Issues and Discussion topics.  As a safe practice, there is also
security-reporting support for currently-released nfoTools.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| VCrayApp 0.1.0-beta | âœ…    |

## Finding nfoTools Vulnerability Announcements

Public vulnerability announcements confirm vulnerabilities, reporting their
nature, their mitigation, and any actions required by those who may be
employing vulnerable software versions. Occassionally, a vulnerability
announcement can explain why a particular situation does not qualify as a
vulnerability.

Find already-issued public vulnerability announcements, if any, for the
nfoTools project/repository at
[nfoTools advisories](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/security/advisories).

## Reporting an nfoTools Vulnerability

See the
[orcmid.github.io Security Sandbox](https://orcmid.github.io/SECURITY.html)
for a walk-through of what to expect, how to kick off a vulnerability report,
and an alternative reporting option.

Securely report an exploitable vulnerability or exposed threat-surface
specific to nfoTools using the vulnerability reporting provision
of the
[nfoTools Project Security](https://github.com/orcmid/miser/security) tab.

## Exclusion of Forked/Cloned Projects

For independent releases of a fork-/clone-based project, it must be clear that
there is no support commitment at the nfoTools Project and the Security Policy
does not extend to the fork/clone.
