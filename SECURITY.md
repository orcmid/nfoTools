# Security Policy

**2024-09-24 Status**: Software releases from the nfoTools project are
intended primarily for use by software developers and provided as open-source
available for inspection and understanding by developers.  Some materials are
intended to support novices and those wanting to dig deeper into software
development.

While there is generally no code that would be installed for end-users, there
are potentially "supply-chain" risks that might emerge with the use of an
nfoTool dependency in a down-stream development.

Although there are no such cases at this time, these security provisions are
in place as a precaution against eventualities where threat surface exposures
might arise.

## Supported Versions

Most considerations of errors and defects can be handled using the project
Issues and Discussion topics.  As a safe practice, there is also
security-reporting support for currently-released nfoTools.

| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please confine vulnerability reporting to Orcmid on GitHub projects that have
supported releases.

To privately report an exploitable vulnerability or exposed threat-surface
that pertains to nfoTools, however unlikely, use the GitHub vulnerability
reporting provision of the
[nfoTools Security](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/security) tab.

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email
communication, send a digitally-signed plaintext email to
[orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have reservations about email security/privacy, enclose an
ASCII-armored file PGP-encrypted using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc)
public key.

Finally, if you wish encrypted responses, sign that message before
encryption in order for your public key to be available for that purpose.
