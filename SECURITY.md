# Security Policy

**2024-09-04 Status**: Software releases from the nfoTools project are intended primarily for use by software developers and provided as open-source available for
inspection and understanding by developers.  Some materials are intended to support novices and those wanting to dig deeper into software development.  

While there is generally no code that would be installed for end-users, there are potentially "supply-chain" risks that might emerge with the use of an nfoTool
dependency in a down-stream development.

Although there are no such cases at this time, these security provisions are in place as a precaution against eventualities where threat surface exposures arise.

## Supported Versions

Most considerations of errors and defects can be handled using the project Issues and Discussion topics.  As a safe practice, there is also security-reporting
support for currently-released nfoTools.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe there is need to engage in a private discussion about a potential threat or threat-surface defect, please use the GitHub
vulerability reporting provision of this project's Security tab.

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email communication, send a digitally-signed plaintext email to 
[orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have concerns about email security/privacy, enclose an ASCII-armored file PGP-encrypted using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc) public key.
