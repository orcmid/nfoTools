                    T211101: RAYLIB GRAPHICAL LIBRARY
                    ---------------------------------

    Raylib is a library of Clean C code that can be used to develop simple
    graphical programs, including videogames, <https://raylib.com>.

    For nfoTools, initial focus is on employment of raylib in programs
    constructed using command-line environments for Microsoft Visual Studio
    Build Tools. Those tools are freely available and easy to install.  See
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T211002/>.

    Microsoft Visual Studio Code is recommended for editing code as part of
    projects that use raylab.  A VS Code setup is used in examples here.
   See <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T211001/>.

TODO

 * Do Progressive Disclosure, starting with install

 * Demonstrate using the VS Developer Command Prompts as a way of establishing
   the Build Tools environment.

 * Illustrate launching of VS Code in the Build Tools command-line
   environment.

 * Demonstrate the edit, save, compile, test, rinse-repeat

 * Deal with operation as part of Developer Command Prompt - We show this
   as a particular case for the VCrayApp demonstrations.

 * There will be a time when we integrate building and execution into the
   VS Code workspace.  Maybe ?!

 * Watch FC_CPP and ensure that supporting materials are appearing here on
   nfoTools/docs.

 * I am anxious about the level of detail and how this can be in the way of
   those who want to work quickly and get into action.  I must get the
   progressive disclosure to also foster skip-aheads and potential future
   review of details.

 * Create a case for the edit-compile connection with Developer Command Prompt
   within this folio, for the demonstration of intellisense.  FC_CPP might
   affirm this also, but it should be done here.  In this case,
   some redundancy may help with the progressive disclosure, even if the same
   images are reused.
