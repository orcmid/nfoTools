Microsoft (2006).  Microsoft Windows XP - Command Shell Overview.  Windows XP
Product Documentation.  Available on the web at [NT Commands Shell Overview](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds_shelloverview.mspx)
(accessed 2006-05-22, cached).
> This page provides a technical overview of the Windows Command Shell.  The
information is suitable for reference by experienced developers and
administrators.  Consult this material for additional nuances and capabilities
after first becoming comfortable with basic Windows console operations.
Related pages linked from this one provide important supplemental information.
The organization below follows the narrative approach of the nfoTools

Computer Hope (2006).  MS-DOS Help and Commands.  Available at [MS-DOS Help](http://www.computerhope.com/msdos.htm)
(accessed 2006-05-22).
> This page and related ones provide a summary of the MS-DOS Console Shell and
the nature of the commands available when hosted by MS-DOS.  Although this
gives an useful alternative presentation, the reader must understand that
although the Windows Command Shell is similar to the MS-DOS Console Shell,
there are important differences in the availability of commands, their
options, and implementation on the different platforms.

Wikibooks (2006).  Guide to Windows Commands.  On-line book draft.  Available
at [Windows Commands](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_Windows_commands)
(accessed 2006-05-28).  (cached)
> This draft guide is focused specifically on the Windows Command Shell, with
some links to historical information.  The cataloging of commands (including
standard command-line utilities commonly available in conjunction with the
shell) also provides comparison with 4NT, an enhanced command shell that can
be used as an alternative to the Windows `cmd.exe`.

Wikipedia (2006). MS-DOS.  On-line encyclopedia entry.  Available at
[MS-DOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) (accessed 2006-05-22).  (cached)
> This, like the Computer Hope page, provides historical background (2006).
Focus is on MS-DOS as a standalone operating system.  Although either MS-DOS
itself (through Windows 98 SE) or an MS-DOS emulator (for Windows 2000 and
later releases) is present in Microsoft Windows configurations, there are
many differences between the Windows Command Shell and Windows console
applications and the MS-DOS Command Shell and MS-DOS applications.
