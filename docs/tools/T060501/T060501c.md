# T060501c: Windows CMD Operation Resources

![Hard Hat Area](../../images/hardhat-logo.gif)

>> ***Ed.Note: This material is dated. It fails to achieve the objective
and extensive revision is called for.***

These resources reflect some of the back-and-forth around the naming of
`cmd.exe` and how, in the treatment for nfoTools, the current Command Prompt
title is used with respect to the CMD command-line environment and operations.

## 1. On-Line Resources

Microsoft (2006).  Microsoft Windows XP - Command Shell Overview.  Windows XP
Product Documentation.  Available on the web at [NT CMD Overview](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/ntcmds_shelloverview.mspx)
(accessed 2006-05-22, cached).
> More-recent materials are required for detailed treatment of Command Prompt
on current Microsoft Windows platforms.  \[Links Pending\]
> This page provides a technical overview of CMD, then-called the Windows
Command Shell.  The information is suitable for reference by experienced
developers and administrators.  Consult this material for additional nuances
and capabilities after first becoming comfortable with basic CMD command-line
operations. Related pages linked from this one provide important supplemental
information. The organization below follows the narrative approach of the
nfoTools presentation of Windows console-sessions concepts and usage.  Later
information is also incorporated:

1. Console session initiation and configuration

    1.1 cmd.exe command interpreter options (cached)

    1.2 Configuring the console window (cached)

2. Command-line processing

    2.1 Basic command format

    2.2 Using multiple and conditional commands (Overview section)

    2.3 Using environment variables (Overview section)

    2.4 Using filters (cached), a special case of redirection

    2.5 Redirection operator reference (cached)

3. Windows XP Command-Line Reference (cached)

    3.1 A-Z command-line reference (cached)

    3.2 New command-line tools in XP (cached)

    3.3 XP Differences in MS-DOS command-line tools (cached)

    3.4 Additional Windows Support Tools (cached)

4. Automating command-line tasks (cached)

    4.1 Using batch files (cached), with the special commands and parameters
    available

    4.2 Using batch parameters (cached)

    4.3 Using the command-based script host (CScript.exe) (cached)

Wikibooks (2006).  Guide to Windows Commands.  On-line book draft.  Available
at [Windows Commands](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_Windows_commands)
(accessed 2006-05-28).  (cached)
> This draft guide is focused specifically on the CMD Command Prompt
command-line operation, with
some links to historical information.  The cataloging of commands (including
standard command-line utilities commonly available in conjunction with the
shell) also provides comparison with 4NT, an enhanced environment that can
be used as an alternative to Windows `cmd.exe`.

## 3. Historical MS-DOS Materials

Computer Hope (2006).  MS-DOS Help and Commands.  Available at [MS-DOS Help](http://www.computerhope.com/msdos.htm)
(accessed 2006-05-22).
> This page and related ones provide a summary of the MS-DOS Console Shell and
the nature of the commands available when hosted by MS-DOS.  Although this
gives an useful alternative presentation, the reader must understand that
although the Windows Command Shell is similar to the MS-DOS Console Shell,
there are important differences in the availability of commands, their
options, and implementation on the different platforms.

Wikipedia (2006). MS-DOS.  On-line encyclopedia entry.  Available at
[MS-DOS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS) (accessed 2006-05-22).  (cached)
> This, like the Computer Hope page, provides historical background (2006).
Focus is on MS-DOS as a standalone operating system.  Although either MS-DOS
itself (through Windows 98 SE) or an MS-DOS emulator (for Windows 2000 and
later releases) is present in Microsoft Windows configurations, there are
many differences between the Windows Command Shell and Windows console
applications and the MS-DOS Command Shell and MS-DOS applications.
