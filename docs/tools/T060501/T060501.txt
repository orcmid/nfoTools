                WINDOWS CMD COMMAND-LINE ENVIRONMENT
                ------------------------------------

    Use of command-line environment and Command Prompt script (.bat) files
    are captured from nfoWare.com folio t060501, revived here, and developed
    farther only as much as needed in support of nfoTools projects and their
    usage.  References for digging deeper are provided.

TODO

 * Migrate the nfoWare.com folio t060501 pages here and recover without
   much clean-up

 * Review resources and find more-recent ones, also confirming links to
   older materials.

 * Provide a toolcraft perspective - using, understanding and confirming,
   then ways to develop and confirm.  Variability to watch out for with
   regard to platforms(?).

 * There needs to be much better restatement for the nfoTools Toolcraft topic.
   Say less about intentions and say more about the structure and the
   progressive disclosure.  This belongs one level up though.

 * We need better nomenclature between command-line, character mode, and
   shell, maybe other terms.  We need to figure out the difference between
   the shell (cmd) and its functions, and stick to it.  The struggle to
   sort out Windows Terminal might help with that.

 * Ponder #15 (https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/issues/15) and come to some
   resolution about how this all works.  I think the business about conHost
   and conPTY is irrelevant in the context of cmd.exe.  I need a way to
   motivate that.  The historical detection of connected/remote device logins
   and firing of a shell (command processor) in response is relevant.  It
   might be helpful to motivate that.

 * Review the additional T060501 nfoWare.com pages and see what else to
   salvage.

 * The resources information is practically archaic.  Move the historical
   materials into that category and surface current information.  This might
   include references to alternatives.

 * Rework to speak of the command-line environment separate from the means
   of accessing it, and how Command Prompt fits in.  The environment case
   matters with respect to how character-mode apps are launched in the same
   environment and how Command Prompt serves as a shell.

 * Add page on navigating with the Console Prompt, including the tab-
   completion provision.

 * Add page on creating shortcuts anywhere, and how to customize the one that
   Windows supplies
