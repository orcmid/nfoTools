These kinds of notes are now kept separately in TODO sections of text files.
Those items are removed as they are resolved.  In previous, web-based folios,
the job jar was preserved, with resolved items moved to the end.

Either form is a personal-memory extension.  The Diary & Job Jar form is
separate from source-code version management and reviewable without having
repository access, whether directly or via a clone.  I rather miss that,
although using Markdown in this fashion is not so pleasant.

|      :-:     |   :-:      |       ---         |
| | 2007-08-11 | t060501e: Make each platform a separate page so there is room just to explore that part.  We will do this for all of the subtopics here. |
| | 2007-08-11 | t060501d: Change all of the cache links to monospace rather than keyboard tags. |
| | 2007-08-11 | Add attribution statements for each of the pages |
| |	2007-08-11 | t060501c: Strip it down to just the Windows Console, focused on Windows XP SP2 capabilities.  Set up for Vista review too, after figuring out how to work the version progression. |
| | 2007-08-11 | t060501c: Change all use of monospace to be with the font face. |
| | 2007-08-11 | t060501: Add a scope section that differentiates the different console shells and what that is all about. |
| | 2006-06-03 | Include on-line courses and tutorials as a category in the C/C++ material, especially on how to learn the languages and programming with them. (Move this item to all of the places where it matters.) |
| | 2006-06-03 | T060501e: Split off the older-systems built-in Help from the current built-in Help. |
| | 2006-05-29 | Comment on how limited MS-DOS and MS-DOS console sessions are for modern Windows PC configurations that have RAM, hard drive, removable media, and processing capacities that are inaccessible under MS-DOS.  The Windows Console Session provides full access to the native Win32 capabilities of the Windows platform.  Also, the current development tools are not designed to produce pure MS-DOS applications.  For that, older Microsoft C compilers and third-party development tools are required. |
| | 2006-05-29 | Sequester the Windows 98SE old DOS materials that are provided on the Windows 98SE CD-ROM. We have no need to operate these on Windows XP, but they will be interesting for ideas about CUA applications and other characteristics.  In addition, if anyone asks questions about these, we will be able to duplicate trouble-shooting situations and respond. |
| | 2006-05-29 | Cache the Windows 98SE .txt files that describe the basic MS-DOS COMMANDS setup. |
| | 2006-05-29 | Find other DOS implementations, check the SourceForge and Wikipedia for sources too. |
| | 2006-05-29 | Find links to the free 4DOS distribution. |
| | 2006-05-29 | Do some Borland 5.01 EasyWin solutions and see if the executables run under Windows XP.  It would be useful to have a wrapper like this or an equivalent Easy-Build, demonstrating the templates and other power of Visual C++ Express Edition.  This goes where we talk about building console applications and simple Windows applications.  Then there's always Windows CUA too. |
| | 2006-05-28 | It looks like I have an avenue to discussing 4NT and ActiveWords as productivity enhancers here.  That's promising. |
| | 2006-05-28 | Another reminder to look at accessibility too. |
| | 2006-05-28 | Check on multi-lingual sources and provide something about finding and using multi-lingual sources, the approach on nfoWare toolcraft to having US English as a baseline with alternative locales and languages as the opportunity arises.  Provide guidance on finding external sources in other languages. |
| | 2006-05-27 | Purple link the T060501c sections. |
| | 2006-05-22 | I need to verify that there is a reliable way to tell a 16-bit application from a 32-bit one. |
| | 2006-05-22 | See if the MS-DOS incarnation of the shell will execute a .cmd file or not.  Also, how do we get these to start separate windows/processes. |
| | 2006-05-22 | Another exercise is to see which commands that are specific to batch processing can be used anywhere.  Also, it is useful to see if call with :label can be used to call into the middle of a different batch program, beside the special case.  \[I suppose shift won't work outside of a batch file, but test that.\] |
| | 2006-05-22 | We need to find the special names for devices that are part of the command shell file-name set.  See if STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR are usable.  That would be cool.  Also check on CON, COM, COMx, LST, PRN, and NUL, plus possibly others. |
| | 2006-05-22 | Using Netsh is probably not something we will get into, since heavy administration is not the purpose here.  However, it is useful as an example of embedded shells and shells that work with extensions in a particular way.  [microsoft.com netsh](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/netsh.mspx?mfr=true).  The same is true of WMIC, the Windows Management Interface Console.  This may be interesting, and WMI might matter for something like ODMA, but we are far from being able to deal with it here.  It might go on a list around trustworthy components and also ActiveODMA though: [microsoft.com wmic](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/wmic.mspx?mfr=true). |
| | 2006-05-22 | There's some funny business when MS-DOS applications are run from within the Windows console session.  It appears that we revert to MS-DOS although it is possible to leap out.  The biggest difference is in the environment and some other features.  Also, file names are all shown as their 8.3 and also in prompts within the MS-DOS shell and also after a 16-bit application is executed.  This is mildly strange. |
| | 2006-05-22 | [MSDN non-admin development](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dv_vstechart/html/tchDevelopingSoftwareInVisualStudioNETWithNon-AdministrativePrivileges.asp) has a neat article on running VS with SUA and ways to get it to work.  This is important for console sessions and other fluency at SUA operation.  Don't let this slip away. |
| | 2006-05-22 | Figure out what is different between the use of tab for filename and command completion and the other options described under the command interpreter options and setup.  Describe these in ways that do not involve having to |
| | 2006-05-22 | The description of the command interpreter options, T060501c5, provides many ideas of exercises and things to try out in providing tutorials and experiments for building console session fluency.  Remember to avoid registry modifications. |
| | 2006-05-21 | We need to see how to handle the console as an interactive display.  Us their any ANSI X3.64 support in XP Console Sessions, what else is there?  (Then there's the whole termcaps situation, and wherever that has gotten to.) |
| | 2006-05-21 | Identify the difference between console as line-by-line and display applications in console sessions.  Consider console as basically the driver's seat, and how console operations and utilities support basic operations and creation of reusable procedures. |
| | 2006-05-21 | Review my notebook for additional items on console-sessions and console applications. |
| | 2006-05-21 |Link to the responses I have provided on the MSDN Forum for VC++ Express Edition |
| | 2006-05-21 | Cover the different cases of console applications. |
| | 2006-05-21 | Demonstrate the relationship of start and direct data as command. |
| | 2006-05-21 | This also becomes a way to make *.bat files and to make links.  We want to make a starter .bat file that allows us to set the display the way we want and to set the initial minimal environment for console-session projects. |
| | 2006-05-21 | Move edit.com as a way of demonstrating the installation and location of an application.  Do this because edit.com will create an edit.ini file in its own location if you attempt to set any of its options. |
| | 2006-05-21 | Also cover the ways console applications can be installed, how they are executed, and the use of the path environment variable to find the executables.  Consider how applications find what they need. |
| | 2006-05-21 | Need to have something about how console applications are hosted in console sessions and the different connections that matter - parameters, default data streams, command-line parameters, result codes, and environment variables. |
| | 2006-05-21 | Use example of standard compilers as using console applications for their utilities, build process, and compiling of code, with IDE systems operating on top of console applications, creating console sessions and batch scripts on-the-fly |
| | 2006-05-21 | Explain .bat files and the prospect of other scripting languages, including csh and wsh, ECMAScript |
| | 2006-05-21 | That should also contain information on the different ways of making console applications |
| | 2006-05-21 | Make a separate section on creating console applications and what their value is |
| | 2006-05-21 | Include how to get information on Windows |
| in progress | 2006-05-28 | Capture use of Windows Help and provide a separate page for the images if called for. |
| in progress 2006-05-28 | 2006-05-21 | Look around Wikipedia and the Internet for more information on console applications, console tools, and useful utilities. |
| in progress 2006-05-27 | 2006-05-21 | We need a bibliography and set of resources on console sessions |
