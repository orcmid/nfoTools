# ToolCraft: Windows CMD Command-Line Environment

![Hard Hat Area](../../images/hardhat-logo.gif)

>> ***Ed.Note: This material is dated. It fails to achieve the objective
and extensive revision is called for.***

This article provides basic orientation for beginning developers and others
who want to understand Microsoft Windows CMD Command Prompt operation and the
command-line environment that it supports.  It is an element of toolcraft in
software development and information technology activities on Windows PCs.

![Command Prompt example](T060501-2021-09-06-1432-CommandPrompt.png)

The basics:

* knowing what the CMD command-line environment is and recognizing one on your
computer
* initiating and terminating command-line operations
* performing common command-line operations
* operating applications in the provided console
* using batch scripts (`.bat` files) in repetitive tasks
* experimenting and exploring additional capabilities available with Command
Prompt
* finding resources and explanations for advanced use of Command Prompt

There is no intention to duplicate the extensive Microsoft and MSDN materials
that are freely available on this topic. Sources of additional materials are
identified.
