# ToolCraft: Windows CMD Command-Line Opration

>> ***Ed.Note: This material is dated. It fails to achieve the objective
and extensive revision is called for.***

This article provides basic orientation for beginning developers and others
who want to understand Microsoft Windows console sessions.

Th material is intended primarily for beginners and newcomers who may have
little or no programming experience and who have had no prior exposure to
console applications and their use in console sessions.  This is an aspect of
Windows fluency that is important for software developers and for
administrators of Microsoft Windows systems.

The material is tutorial in nature.  Focus is on basic exercises and examples
for self-guided development of their own fluency:

* knowing what a console session is and recognize one on your computer
* initiating and terminating console sessions
* performing common command-line operations
* operating applications in a console session
* experimenting and exploring additional capabilities available in console
sessions
* finding resources and explanations for advanced use of console sessions

There is no intention to duplicate the extensive Microsoft and MSDN materials
that are freely available on this topic. Instead, I want to create a
gently-climbing on-ramp to assist those for whom the subject is unfamiliar.
The goal is to achieve enough basic familiarity and practice so that users can
confidently discover further detail and advanced applications on their own.

I invite discussion about these tools and the emphasized toolcraft in the
[Discussion section](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/discussions).
Improvements and removal of defects in this particular documentation can be
reported and addressed in the
[Issues section](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/issues).
