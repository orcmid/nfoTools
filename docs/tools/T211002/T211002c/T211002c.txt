                  T211002c: VS BUILD TOOLS INSTALLATION
                  -------------------------------------

    Choosing Tools for Visual Studio <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com>
    leads to download and installation of a Visual Studio Installer, the
    utility for selective downloading of components and libraries that will be
    usable from the build tools command-line environment.

    Visual Studio Installer remains available for obtaining updates and
    making any desired adjustment to the  configuration of installed
    components.

    A starter configuration is demonstrated here.  It is sufficient for use
    in all nfoTools-based C/C++ projects.  Fundamental command-line
    development activity is featured, providing a solid foundation for
    advanced use later on.

TODO

 * Mastering the developer command prompt will be the next subfolio.

 * Making directories and organizing simple code projects will be next.

 * Getting VS2022 Build Tools Updates is also important, along with getting
   versions beyond VS2022.

 * It is now more difficult to find VS Build Tools on the Microsoft Site.
   <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022>
   It is necessary to search for that.  The above permalink is provided at the
   destination.  This changes things.  I need to figure out how to keep pace
   with the disappearance of this on the developer and VS pages.

 * Oops, false alarm.  I provide the above link already.  However I need to
   review the detailed alternative to ensure that things still work and that
   I have a means to introduce an update when things are changed out from
   under this approach.
