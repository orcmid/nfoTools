C Language has a famous first program.  Creating and operating that program is demonstrated, with links to expanded detail that may be needed.

  - [1. The Simple Process](#1-the-simple-process)

## 1. The Simple Process

The overall object, using the single-file program, `hello.c` is to convert it
into a program that can be run on the computer.  There are essentiall two
steps.

![The 2-step compile and run](T060101d1-2023-06-07-1525-CL-Hello.png)

With operation in a Command Prompt initialized with a Build Tools Environment,
the two steps are

- `>CL hello.c` to compile the file `hello.c` into the program file
`hello.exe` without error
` `>hello` to operate `hello.exe` as a command-line program, obtaining the
message build into the code.

There many other details, some presented as compilation progressed, others
internal to that progression.

The `hello.exe` program was compiled to be operated on a command-line. The
`hello.exe` program is self-contained, although it must be operated under
a command prompt.  There will ways to arrange for that operation to be done
smoothly.

For now, explore deeper into compilation process and how larger
programs can be organized in C Language modules and libraries for
more-elaborate construction and operation.
