TODO

 * Describe the initial steps and a little about why but mostly what.

 * We will take the original K&R hello.c first.  It passes with no complaints
   from modern tools.  We will go through the construction that reaches the
   "hello, world" achievement.

 * The next page will do the deconstruction/reconstruction and identify
   matters of form and substance with regard to the hello.c code.

 * Although I had favored puts, fputs is a better choice to deal with the use
   of '/n' explicitly.

 * Changes of command prompt and shortcuts will not be done until hello.c is
   all unfolded and we are ready for bigger things.

 * We will summarize what is important.  We can also take apart the CL.exe
   compilation at some point, with headers, preprocessor, creation of *.obj,
   selection of libraries, and linking to make the *.exe.  This might be best
   at Build Tools though.

 * There will be placeholders, sketches in other tool folders to support this
   back and forth.

 * After getting to Hello, there should be indication of directions to take
   in expanding ones understanding and flexible operation.
    - cmd.exe for as long as it is supplied in Windows
    - Visual Studio Code for text editing and additional development support
    - More about Visual Studio Build Tools and how employed (e.g., in
      construction sets)
