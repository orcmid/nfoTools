## C/C++ Programming for Beginners and the Curious

Interested in understanding C/C++ and programming for the Microsoft Windows
platform?

* Be experienced using a desktop PC and able to download and install software
from the Internet  No programming and software-development experience is
required.
* Learn how to use command-line/console-mode utilities and software.  These
are the easiest kinds of programs to start making in C/C++.  That provides a
foundation that more-advanced programming and tooling is built upon.

## The Basics

\[TBD\]

There is no intention to duplicate the extensive public materials and also
the Windows-oriented Microsoft and MSDN materials that are freely available
on this topic.  Recommended materials and language references are identified.
