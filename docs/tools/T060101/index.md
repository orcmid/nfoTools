## C/C++ Programming for Beginners and the Curious

* Identifying resources for those interested in understanding more about the
use of C/C++ programming for development of software using the native
Microsoft Windows platform.
* This material is suitable for someone who is experienced  in using a desktop
PC and able to download and install software from the Internet (or from a
CD-ROM in the back of a book).  No programming and software-development
experience is required.
* It is valuable e to have a confident acquaintance with usage of Microsoft
Windows.  Willingness to learn how to use command-line/console-mode utilities
and software is also important.  These are the easiest kinds of programs to
begin constructing using C/C++.  That provides a foundation that all
more-sophisticated programming can be built upon.

## The Basics

\[TBD\]

There is no intention to duplicate the extensive public materials and also
the Windows-oriented Microsoft and MSDN materials that are freely available
on this topic.  Recommended materials and language references are identified.
