## C/C++ Programming for Beginners and the Curious

For nfoTools projects of all kinds, use of the C Programming Language
will be in [Clean C](b/#Harbison2002), a form which can be compiled as "pure"
C Language and also as C++ Language programs.  The use of "C/C++" emphasizes
that connection.  Modern compilers tend to be C/C++ compilers (at least) and
will accept Clean C as either C or C++.

Substantial software, especially open-source software, is being
developed and maintained using C Language.  C++ programs
can and often do rely on existing code libraries written in C.  Many other
programming systems allow components authored in C Language to be added/used
and may be implemented in C Language themselves.

Here there will not be much attention on C++ features that are not acceptable
in C Language.  The objective, instead, is to focus on the Clean C as a
foundation on some valuable programming language principles and as a launching
pad for future efforts, whether expanding into C++ or other programming
languages/dialects.

## Historical Context

C and C++ are two heavily-used programming languages.
[C Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language))
 was introduced in the 1970s, evolved over time, and formalized in
 International  Standards, and spoken of as ISO Standard C.  (The term ANSI C
 is archaic, generally refering to the
 [C89 ISO counterpart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#History).  There are some
 variations defined in [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) that are
 not incorporated in the ISO Standards.)

C has evolved over time, sometimes to strengthen its connection with C++, and
also to encourage dependable programming practices.  An important shift
occured between [C99](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C99) (issued around 1999)
and [C11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_(C_standard_revision)) (issued
around 2011).  There are more features in C11, including some optional ones
that were not part of C99.  At the same time, C11 reduced some mandatory
provisions of C99 to be optional.

The current specification,
[C17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C17_(C_standard_revision)), is a
maintenance release.  [C23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C2x) is imminent at
this time.  C23 will provide some new extensions and deprecate or completely
obsolete some older features that have been discouraged previously.

## The Basics

\[TBD\]

There is no intention to duplicate the extensive public materials and also
the Windows-oriented Microsoft and MSDN materials that are freely available
on this topic.  Recommended materials and language references are identified.
