TODO

 * Organize better.  Focus on C Language materials and also a litte on C/C++
   compilers and libraries.

  * Coverage of the C, C++, C#, Objective-C language relationships
    <https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/c-vs-cplusplus-vs-csharp-vs-objective-c/>

  * Also the Use C++ and C in Visual Studio Code.  This might be referenced
    here and addressed more in the Visual Studio Code materials.  There needs
    to be more emphasis on the use for C and also maybe some more gentle work
    up to the VS Code integration with Intellisence, etc.
    <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc>.

  * <https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines> is valuable
    for C++ and sometimes for C.  It does not get at the difference between
    what the code is versus what it is for.  It does help with connection
    to what the code realizes an interpretation/representation of, though
    comments are still required.  This also came up on ResearchGate with
    respect to mechanized proofs and their checking.

  * Include Knuth books on other things, such as Fun & Games, that may also be
    instructive.

  * Include a section on lessons, maybe a different section on examples to
    learn from.

  * Include a section on learning other languages.

  * I need to include materials on algorithms as well.  And point out that
    a higher notion of algorithm is preferable, with it being convenient in
    many cases to implement them in a working programming language.

  * I wonder if I need to do something about the references and citations in
    Orcmid's Lair Readings.  At the moment, GitHub seems more durable than
    orcmid.com.

  * For <stdio.h> there are these descriptions:
    <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/stdio_h.htm>
    <https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.3.0?topic=files-stdioh-standard-input-output>
    <https://www.tutorialspoint.com/c_standard_library/stdio_h.htm>

  * I need to add something about gcc and also a bit about preferred setups,
    in the case of native flavors versus more-complicated ones (and WSL).
    This would be mostly to aid in using examples and books that employ gcc
    as the assumed compiler system.  I don't want to get too far into it.
    This is mostly to help folks figure out the differences in nomenclature
    and how to port such materials to employment of VS Build Tools

  * There may be something in Git4Win also, such as the MingW bash version.
    This is all for later or elsewhere.
