TODO

 * We will summarize what is important.  We can also take apart the CL.exe
   compilation at some point, with headers, preprocessor, creation of *.obj,
   selection of libraries, and linking to make the *.exe.  This might be best
   at Build Tools though.

 * There will be placeholders, sketches in other tool folders to support this
   back and forth.

 * After getting to Hello, there should be indication of directions to take
   in expanding ones understanding and flexible operation.
    - cmd.exe for as long as it is supplied in Windows
    - Visual Studio Code for text editing and additional development support
    - More about Visual Studio Build Tools and how employed (e.g., in
      construction sets)
