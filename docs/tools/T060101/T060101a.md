These kinds of notes are now kept separately in TODO sections of text files.
Those items are removed as they are resolved.  In previous, web-based folios,
the job jar was preserved, with resolved items moved to the end.  In this
preservation of the legacy job jar, the items completed on nfoware.com are
omitted.

Either form of TODOs is a personal-memory extension.  The Diary & Job Jar
form is separate from source-code version management providing history without
needing to have access to the code repository, whether direct or via clone.
I rather miss that, although using Markdown in this fashion is not pleasant.
