# ***nfoTools** Toolcraft Notebook*

For deeper, practical understanding of nfoTools topics, it is important to
work with a personal computer and rely on some available software tools.

General [PC usage skills](../skills) are important.

To explore, construct, and extend nfoTools, facility with some available tools
is essential.  That's where Toolcraft comes in.

For nfoTools, the primary toolcraft consists of specialized techniques for
development, maintenance, and use of Microsoft Windows on desktop personal
computers.  Prerequisite tools are either present in Microsoft Windows or
they are freely-available to download and install.
