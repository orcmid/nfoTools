For deeper, practical understanding of nfoTools topics, it is important to
work with a personal computer and rely on some available software tools.

General [PC usage skills](../skills) are important.

To explore, construct, and extend nfoTools, facility with some available tools
is essential.  That's where Toolcraft comes in.

For nfoTools, the primary toolcraft consists of specialized techniques for
development, maintenance, and use of Microsoft Windows applications on and for
desktop personal computers.  Prerequisite tools are either present in
Microsoft Windows or they are freely-available to download and install.

For background on toolcraft, its benefits and dangers, see
[The Craft in Toolcraft](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/notes/N070801/).
