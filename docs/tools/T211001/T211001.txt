TODO

 * Recommend VS Code or editor first, then GitHub for Windows, then
   TortoiseGit and GitHub Desktop, then Visual Studio Developer Tools or
   Community Edition.

 * I don't think this is the correct sequence.  I need
   to tie it into spiraling and projects here that always build.  This means
   I can recommend teething exercises that work.  The raylib ones matter as
   is something like building Adv10, although that will depend on the state
   of Adv10 at the time.  I need to fix its build process now (2022-04-27).

 * I am uncertain about the sequence.  VS Code will depend on Visual Studio
   Developer Tools for operation of the C/C++ intellisense.

 * I am also uncertain about Git and GitHub.  I can't determine or don't
   remember how VS Code deals with Git if it is not already installed.

 * Finding the install location of VC and C/C++ Build tools will be
   important.  The use of a developer command prompt is now essential to
   having VS Code to provide intellisense along with resolution of #include
   requirements.  This has to be unravelled.

 * Need to establish how far one can get with Visual Studio Code on the Web.
   I need some development about that.  I think it is very tied to having a
   GitHub project.  I need to see how that aspect works.

 * Treat how Visual Studio Web works with local arrangements.

 * Consider how it works with GitHub projects.

 * Wondering how VS Code Web building, etc., work.

 * Deal with operation as part of Developer Command Prompt

 * Deal with VS 2019 and VS 2017 installation and also detection.  Unclear
   about 2015 and earlier any longer.  There is the need to be able to rebuild
   and test and to patch that may require continued support of those releases.

 * Now it's more important to deal with VS 2022

 * Resolve the CMD Command Prompt situation as follows.  We will speak of the
   command-line ENVIRONMENT that CMD establishes.  Then things like VC/C++
   Tools and the customization of the environment fits in.  Also, the general
   terminal/console model can be spoken of separately, in a combination of
   notes and specific toolcrafts, including developing-for, not just
   developing-in.  Create projects for this.

 * Watch FC_CPP and ensure that supporting materials are appearing here on
   nfoTools/docs.

 * Park VS Code on the Web screen captures here until have a better place for
   them.

 * I am anxious about the level of detail and how this can be in the way of
   those who want to work quickly and get into action.  I must get the
   progressive disclosure to also foster skip-aheads and potential future
   review of details.

 * Placeholder: on Compiler Explorer Execution and Static Analysis Support for
   MSVC.   https://godbolt.org/
   https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/execution-and-static-analysis-support-for-msvc-on-compiler-explorer/

 * There may be license issues that someone might have to deal with.  It
   appears that the open-source use does require the same license as for the
   community editions.  ALso,
   <https://devblogs.microsoft.com/cppblog/updates-to-visual-studio-build-tools-license-for-c-and-cpp-open-source-projects/>

 * A new link on the Build Tools:
   <https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/>.
   I should link to T211002 though.

 * Useful to point out that VS Code works with WSL and Linux build chains.
   <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode>

 * VS Code is no longer showing me where lines have been deleted, inserted,
   or changed until they get checked into GitHub.  Those useful annotations
   are missing and I don't know what setting restores them, if any.
   [SOLUTION: It has to do with needing to authorize working under a folder
   that is a Git working folder.  I need to point that out somehow.]

 * I need a TOC of pages here so that I can start provisional ones, whether
   exposed or not, as targets for URLs in other materials, such as description
   of .vscode\ in VCrayApp.  Once I do this, I can't change the URL, so there
   may be an "out-of-order" sequence in the higher-level manifest.

 * There needs to be a quickstart case, using VS Code as part of a beginner
   operation, such as doing a VCrayApp install or starting small C Language
   projects.

 * Tentative organization
