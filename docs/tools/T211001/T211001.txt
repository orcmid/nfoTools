TODO

 * Recommend VS Code or editor first, then GitHub for Windows, then
   TortoiseGit and GitHub Desktop, then VIsual Studio Developer Tools or
   Community Edition

 * Finding the install location of VC and C/C++ Build tools will be
   important

 * Need to establish how far one can get with Visual Studio Code on the Web.

 * Deal with operation as part of Developer Command Prompt

 * Setup and test for VS 2022 (17.0) but don't post anything until official
   for building code eligible for distribution and production use.

 * Deal with VS 2019 and VS 2017 installation and also detection.  Unclear
   about 2015 and earlier any longer.  There is the need to be able to rebuild
   and test and to patch that may require continued support of those releases.

 * Resolve the CMD Command Prompt situation as follows.  We will speak of the
   command-line ENVIRONMENT that CMD establishes.  Then things like VC/C++
   Tools and the customization of the environment fits in.  Also, the general
   terminal/console model can be spoken of separately, in a combination of
   notes and specific toolcrafts, including developing-for, not just
   developing-in.  Create projects for this.

 * Watch FC_CPP and ensure that supporting materials are appearing here on
   nfoTools/docs.

 * Park VS Code on the Web screen captures here until have a better place for
   them.
