TODO

 * Recommend VS Code or editor first, then GitHub for Windows, then
   TortoiseGit and GitHub Desktop, then VIsual Studio Developer Tools or
   Community Edition

 * I am uncertain about the sequence.  VS Code will depend on Visual Studio
   Developer Tools for operation of the C/C++ intellisense.

 * I am also uncertain about Git and GitHub.  I can't determine or don't
   remember how VS Code deals with Git if it is not already installed.

 * Finding the install location of VC and C/C++ Build tools will be
   important

 * Need to establish how far one can get with Visual Studio Code on the Web.
   I need some development about that.  I think it is very tied to having a
   GitHub project.  I need to see how that aspect works.

 * Treat how Visual Studio Web works with local arrangements.

 * Consider how it works with GitHub projects.

 * Wondering how VS Code Web building, etc., work.

 * Deal with operation as part of Developer Command Prompt

 * Deal with VS 2019 and VS 2017 installation and also detection.  Unclear
   about 2015 and earlier any longer.  There is the need to be able to rebuild
   and test and to patch that may require continued support of those releases.

 * Resolve the CMD Command Prompt situation as follows.  We will speak of the
   command-line ENVIRONMENT that CMD establishes.  Then things like VC/C++
   Tools and the customization of the environment fits in.  Also, the general
   terminal/console model can be spoken of separately, in a combination of
   notes and specific toolcrafts, including developing-for, not just
   developing-in.  Create projects for this.

 * Watch FC_CPP and ensure that supporting materials are appearing here on
   nfoTools/docs.

 * Park VS Code on the Web screen captures here until have a better place for
   them.

 * I am anxious about the level of detail and how this can be in the way of
   those who want to work quickly and get into action.  I must get the
   progressive disclosure to also foster skip-aheads and potential future
   review of details.
