TODO

 * Figure out the situation with Git for Windows being so beginner painful
   to install.

 * Emphasize on-ramps, prerequisites, and the worked cases on how to install
   various tools and make use of them.

 * Recommend VS Code or editor first, then GitHub for Windows, then
   TortoiseGit and GitHub Desktop, then VIsual Studio Developer Tools or
   Community Edition

 * Need Visual Studio Developer Tools first for Developer Command Prompt
   and launching of code by command prompt

 * Finding the install location of VC and C/C++ Build tools will be
   important.  Promote the shortcut access and reuse.

 * Not certain about when we get farther into keyboards as tools, especially
   on the digital, computer-system side.  Maybe start on skills, then more
   here on toolcraft of it?

 * Add tools entries for hashing (sha256check) and verifying digital
   signatures, then how to create them.  Documentation should always cover
   usage first, creation secondly, in progressive disclosure.

 * Setup and test for VS 2022 (17.0) but don't post anything until official
   for building code eligible for distribution and production use.  Comment
   about insider/preview usage and using only for verification and preparation
   rather than release builds.  Dress rehearsals only :).

 * Deal with VS 2019 and VS 2017 installation and also detection.  Unclear
   about 2015 and earlier any longer.  There is the need to be able to rebuild
   and test and to patch that may require continued support of those releases.

 * Resolve the CMD Command Prompt situation as follows.  We will speak of the
   command-line ENVIRONMENT that CMD establishes.  Then things like VC/C++
   Tools and the customization of the environment fits in.  Also, the general
   terminal/console model can be spoken of separately, in a combination of
   notes and specific toolcrafts, including developing-for, not just
   developing-in.  Create projects for this.

 * Contrast with GUI environments with respect to similarities and differences

 * We need toolcraft for the VC Build Tools, especially cl.exe and the
   way options work.  This may extend to other tools in that family.  Check
   the prompts for the other tools.

 * Triage T060301 Computer Arithmetic Gotchas

 * Triage T060302 Using VC++ 2005 Express Edition

 * Triage T170201 Construction Sets

 * Triage T170301 WinCon Construction Sets

 * The Construction Kits might be something other than Toolcraft.  Think
   it over.

 * Look into what must be figured out around CL.exe that shows up in the
   rayLab rawCL script development.

 * Watch FC_CPP and ensure that supporting materials are appearing here on
   nfoTools/docs.

 * "Coding standards" and following the standards of of a project being
   contributed to are important.

 * There are two cases.  Explaining what practices are being observed, and
   how they are meant to be useful.  There is a lot of that here on nfoTools
   itself, and also in nfoTools/docs.  Some is docEng.  Some is craft.

 * There is also explanation of project conventions and ensuring that any
   issues, discussions, and pull requests conform to the project standards.

 * The material difference between C and C++ library/external linking needs
   to be made clear.  First, the difference, and how it is revealed in
   headers and source codes.  And how there are even more cases, such as
   the entry-exit conventions in calling that are not quite orthogonal.
   This is partly a Build Tools conversation, and also one about C/C++
   programming.  Reflect that everywhere it matters.
