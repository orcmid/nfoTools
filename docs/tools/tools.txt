TODO

 * Figure out the situation with Git for Windows being so beginner painful
   to install.

 * Emphasize on-ramps, prerequisites, and the worked cases on how to install
   various tools and make use of them.

 * Recommend VS Code or editor first, then GitHub for Windows, then
   TortoiseGit and GitHub Desktop, then VIsual Studio Developer Tools or
   Community Edition

 * Finding the install location of VC and C/C++ Build tools will be
   important

 * Not certain about when we get farther into keyboards as tools, especially
   on the digital, computer-system side.  Maybe start on skills, then more
   here on toolcraft of it?

 * Add tools entries for hashing (sha256check) and verifying digital
   signatures, then how to create them.  Documentation should always cover
   usage first, creation secondly, in progressive disclosure.

 * Setup and test for VS 2022 (17.0) but don't post anything until official
   for building code eligible for distribution and production use.

 * Deal with VS 2019 and VS 2017 installation and also detection.  Unclear
   about 2015 and earlier any longer.  There is the need to be able to rebuild
   and test and to patch that may require continued support of those releases.

 * Resolve the CMD Command Prompt situation as follows.  We will speak of the
   command-line ENVIRONMENT that CMD establishes.  Then things like VC/C++
   Tools and the customization of the environment fits in.  Also, the general
   terminal/console model can be spoken of separately, in a combination of
   notes and specific toolcrafts, including developing-for, not just
   developing-in.  Create projects for this.

 * Contrast with GUI environments with respect to similarities and differences
