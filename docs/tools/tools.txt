TODO

 * Figure out the situation with Git for Windows being so beginner painful
   to install.

 * Emphasize on-ramps, prerequisites, and the worked cases on how to install
   various tools and make use of them.

 * Recommend VS Code or editor first, then GitHub for Windows, then
   TortoiseGit and GitHub Desktop, then VIsual Studio Developer Tools or
   Community Edition

 * Finding the install location of VC and C/C++ Build tools will be
   important

 * Use the ADM-3A image to illustrate keyboard evolution.

   Also find a Dvorak keyboard, and some manual, then electric, keyboards.
   These are all in English.  There needs to be more allowance for other
   variations, "dead" keys, etc.  But first, there is keyboarding, then
   keyboards.

 * Oh wait, keyboarding is in skills. Duhh.  Not certain about when we get
   farther into keyboards.  Maybe a little there, a little more here?
