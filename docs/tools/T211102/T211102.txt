                       T211102: GIT AND GITHUB
                       -----------------------

This topic introduces Git, GitHub, and Tortoise Git.  These support
programming projects on Windows PCs as part of backing up your own work,
using projects of others, and working with teams.

These tools are also useful for keeping up-to-date with with open-source
projects such as raylib and also nfoTools.  There's a rich supply of efforts
to rely on and also take part in.

TODO

 * Do Progressive Disclosure

 * Install Git4Windows first.  This has become painful with too many mystery
   option choices.  Smooth that out.

 * Need to reconcile the interaction with VS Code and Git.  It looks like
   Git can be later.

 * GitHub account and use of the GitHub Desktop can then be started up.
   Take it easy on first exploring Git, following projects, and seeing the
   different cases of Issues, Discussion, Wikis, Projects, and what repos
   look like.  This should be selective.

 * Creating a GitHub project and repository for personal work, whether private
   or public is next.

 * Tortoise Git is recommended for its tagging of file explorer entries with
   their Git status is invaluable.  This goes with the skilss on File explorer
   usage on Windows and also in conjunction with operation in a command-line
   environment.

 * Tortoise Git seems to now require Git to be installed already.  I don't
   think the GitHub Desktop for PC installs Git either.  Must check that out
   and confirm a good sequence for where this fits well in setting up other
   tools.

 * There a Git and Open-Source Learning Series offered by Microsoft.
   <https://t.co/TvQaOXQU9N>
   That's an unbelievable URL one step past t.co.  Scary.  Not certain what I
   signed-up for.  This looks good though.  Must find a way to recommend this
     o Learning Git by exploring open-source repositories
     o Exploring a Git repository using Visual Studio
     o Contributing to an open-source project
     o Add your existing code to Git and GitHub
     o Next steps
   This is very well done.  I don't know how much can be pealed out from under
   Visual Studio and accomplished with Visual Studio Code or even completely
   separately.
     o There are some good links in the Welcome email.  They all feature VS
       and I'm uncertain how that might factor out.
     o I see by the second week, that this is all done from inside Visual
       Studio, finding and looking into GitHub and also cloning from GitHub
       directly under Visual Studio.  There are even more links.  The
       treatment seems oriented to UWP and C# also.
    I will point this out.
