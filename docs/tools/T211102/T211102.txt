                       T211102: GIT AND GITHUB
                       -----------------------

This topic introduces Git, GitHub, and Tortoise Git.  These support
programming projects on Windows PCs as part of backing up your own work,
using projects of others, and working with teams.

These tools are also useful for keeping up-to-date with with open-source
projects such as raylib and also nfoTools.  There's a rich supply of efforts
to rely on and also take part in.

TODO

 * Do Progressive Disclosure

 * Install Git4Windows first.  This has become painful with too many mystery
   option choices.  Smooth that out.

 * Need to reconcile the interaction with VS Code and Git.  It looks like
   Git can be later.

 * GitHub account and use of the GitHub Desktop can then be started up.
   Take it easy on first exploring Git, following projects, and seeing the
   different cases of Issues, Discussion, Wikis, Projects, and what repos
   look like.  This should be selective.

 * Creating a GitHub project and repository for personal work, whether private
   or public is next.

 * Tortoise Git is recommended for its tagging of file explorer entries with
   their Git status is invaluable.  This goes with the skilss on File explorer
   usage on Windows and also in conjunction with operation in a command-line
   environment.

 * Tortoise Git seems to now require Git to be installed already.  I don't
   think the GitHub Desktop for PC installs Git either.  Must check that out
   and confirm a good sequence for where this fits well in setting up other
   tools.
