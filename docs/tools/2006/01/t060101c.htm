<h2><a name="1" href="#1">1</a>. C/C++ Compilers</h2>
<blockquote>
	<p>For basic development of C and C++ Language programs, there are 
	freely-available professional-level compilers that operate on current Microsoft 
	Windows platforms (i.e., Windows 2000, Windows XP SP2, Windows Vista, and 
	beyond):</p>

	<a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/visualc/Aa336490.aspx">no longer 
	available</a>.&nbsp; It has been replaced by the Visual C++ 2005 Express 
	Edition.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the optimizing compiler that 
	was shipped as part of Visual Studio .NET 2003 
	Professional.&nbsp; It is a command-line compiler that is also fully usable 
	for study and experimentation in standard C and C++ command-line application 
	development.&nbsp; The compiler can also be used to build complete Microsoft 
	Windows applications once additional libraries and development utilities are obtained.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although no longer available, some of the early <i><b>
	nfoWare</b></i> projects are verified with this compiler as well as 
	more-recent VC++ editions.</small></p>

	<p><b><a name="1.3" target="_top" href="#1.3">1.3</a> Other Versions of Microsoft Visual C++</b><small><br />are found packaged in 
	older training and education packages under names such as 
	Learning Edition and Standard Edition.&nbsp; Some books also include versions of Visual C++ on an included 
	CD-ROM.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The advantage of all of these versions is the inclusion 
	of an integrated development environment and additional tools required for 
	development of Microsoft Windows applications.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	The license conditions on some of these editions may limit usage to 
	educational and personal use.&nbsp; If you intend to develop software for

	<a target="_top" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/features/">
	Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition</a> (and other Express editions) available 
	for free download through November 7, 2006.&nbsp; This version can be 
	employed indefinitely and for any purpose in much the same way as the Visual 
	C++ Toolkit 2003.&nbsp; A key feature is inclusion of a version of the 
	Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment for editing and building 
	programs.&nbsp; The tutorial and reference materials available with this 
	version may make it appealing for usage in command-line compiling as well.</small></p>

	These compilers are designed for operation on GNU/Linux.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
	Versions for Windows require installation of additional software for

	useful for someone interested in learning about and developing for the

	<p><b><a name="2.2" target="_top" href="#2.2">2.2</a></b> For substantial programming work, a programming editor is recommended.&nbsp;
