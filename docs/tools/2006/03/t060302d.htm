<h2>1. <a name="Approach">Approach</a></h2>
<blockquote>
	<p>In choosing to develop programs with one of the Visual Studio 2005 
	languages, it is important to be clear what your experience level is and 
	what your objective for programming is.&nbsp; </p>
	<p>Sometimes you won't know where you lack needed experience.&nbsp; You will 
	require a resilient attitude about simplifying yourself out of difficulties.&nbsp; 
	Learn how how to extricate yourself when you have started something that you 
	discover is too large or too complex for your current level of mastery.&nbsp; 
	Also, learn how to use reference materials for resolving problems and 
	clarifying your understanding of the fine points of language and software 
	library features.&nbsp; The more experimentation and building of small 
	programs to check your understanding of available material and examples, the 
	better.</p>
	<p>Because Visual C++ supports a particularly rich C/C++ language with a 
	wide range of applications and platform choices, it is essential to have a 
	focused objective for what you want to achieve as your initial level of competency.&nbsp; You must also be prepared to deal 
	with the fact that not all capabilities of Visual C++ can be used together.&nbsp; 
	There are also important differences in how the different configurations and 
	templates work, and this will require some patience to sort out. </p>
	<p>These <i><b>nfoWare</b></i> resources and toolcraft tips are organized 
	for a bottom-up exploration of C/C++ and the Visual C++ 2005 Express 
	Edition.&nbsp; Emphasis is on basic concepts and fundamentals.&nbsp; The 
	development of Windows GUI programming is introduced only after developing a 
	thorough foundation using console application development.&nbsp; Using 
	the Win32 API (essentially a C Language interface) precedes use of 
	more-complex object-oriented libraries and the Component Object Model (COM).&nbsp; 
	There is little attention to managed code.&nbsp; It is my considered opinion 
	that Visual C# is a far superior starting point for learning about managed 
	code and rapid development of Windows GUI applications.&nbsp; Because the 
	Windows .NET platform supports interoperability between C/C++ and C# 
	applications, you can also learn to use both Visual C++ and Visual C#.&nbsp; 
	It is desirable to have solid footing in one before starting with the other, 
	especially if you are a beginner.</p>
	<p><font color="#800080">{<b>AuthorNote: </b>There will be a decision tree 
	or other device that will assist newcomers in choosing a custom path for 
	self-study and exploration using Visual C++.&nbsp; This will also help 
	reconcile whether VC++ is the appropriate language (assuming there is choice 
	in the matter).}</font></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>2. <a name="Books">Books</a></h2>
<blockquote>
	<p>There are extensive materials on learning and using the C and C++ 
	languages.&nbsp; These are discussed under other Toolcraft topics
	<font color="#800080">{cross-references to be supplied}</font>.&nbsp; The 
	books cited in this section address the unique features of the Visual 
	C++ 2005 IDE and development of programs that run on Microsoft Windows.&nbsp; 
	In some cases, customization will be required for adjustment to the 
	capabilities of the Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition.</p>

		<dt><a name="Horton2006">Horton, Ivar.</a> (2006)</dt>
		<dd><i>Ivar Horton's Beginning Visual C++ 2005</i>.&nbsp; Wiley 
		(Indianapolis, IN: 2006).&nbsp; ISBN 0-7645-7197-4 pbk/website.<small><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; At over 1100 pages, this is a superior beginner book.&nbsp; There is an 
		important caveat (p. xxxvii): &quot;<em>To use this book you need any of Visual Studio 2005 Standard 
		Edition, Visual Studio 2005 Professional Edition, or Visual Studio 2005 
		Team System.&nbsp; <strong>Note that Visual C++ Express 2005 is </strong>
		</em><strong>not<em> sufficient because the MFC is not included</em></strong><em>
		</em>[my emphasis]&quot;.&nbsp; I recommend the book anyway.&nbsp; Less than 
		half 
		of the book content depends on Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC).&nbsp; There 
		will be some differences between the illustrations of Visual Studio in the 
		book and the specific displays and options of Visual C++ Express 
		Edition.&nbsp; I don't think that will be any problem for console 
		applications and for basic Windows Forms applications.&nbsp; Here are 
		the compelling features:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Horton is extremely careful 
		to explain, from the very beginning, what the different development 
		models are and he provides instruction in all of them.&nbsp; He builds 
		up from ISO/ANSI C++ console application, then to native and managed 
		(C++/CLI) Windows applications.&nbsp; He even makes it clear that you 
		can build both managed and native (Win32) console applications.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Horton has the luxury of space to explain the features of the 
		IDE and illustrate them as part of careful attention to what projects 
		are and what they involve in the VS 2005 model.&nbsp; He deals with 
		debugging and how to understand error messages too.&nbsp; There's other 
		evidence of a careful, deliberate approach.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The first 10 chapters (that's 600 pages) take you slowly through 
		ISO/ANSI C++ via console applications.&nbsp; MFC is used in only a 
		couple of illustrative examples.&nbsp; At the end of each chapter Horton adds information on features of C++/CLI, the extensions that 
		apply to managed-code applications.&nbsp; This parallel progression 
		seems quite valuable, helping you to understand what works in all of 
		modern C++ and what is specific to the C++/CLI extensions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Chapter 11 begins the treatment of Windows programming.&nbsp; It 
		provides the execution model and illustrates it with a Windows API 
		application, an MFC-built application, and a Windows Forms (C++/CLI) 
		application.&nbsp; This helps clarify what the differences are and how 
		Visual C++ is targetable to different platforms and environments.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Chapters 12-20 are all about using the MFC to build native 
		Windows applications.&nbsp; MFC concepts and class usage are everywhere.&nbsp; 
		These won't be useful to the non-MFC developer, who will need to find 
		other resources for this aspect of Windows development.&nbsp; (Chapter 
		18 does provide useful coverage of how DLLs work and how to build your 
		own using MFC wizards.&nbsp; Express users can make DLLs too, just not 
		this way.)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Chapters 21-22 wrap it up by going into the use of Windows Forms 
		for building Windows applications for the Common Language Runtime (CLR).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		<dt><a name="Miller2006">Miller, Aaron., Ford, Jerry Lee, Jr</a>. (2006)</dt>
		<dd><i>Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition Programming for the 
		Absolute Beginner</i>.&nbsp; Thomson Course Technology PTR (Boston: 2006).&nbsp; 
		ISBN 1-59200-816-X pbk.<small><br />&nbsp;&nbsp; This book has received 
		mixed reviews.&nbsp; Fundamentally it is about the C++/CLI (.NET 2.0 
		managed-code) aspect of VC++ 2005.&nbsp; It neglects console applications, native Windows Applications, and 
		usage of ANSI/ISO standard C and C++&nbsp; as supported by VC++ 
		2005.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A greater concern is that the book does not live up to the &quot;no experience 
		required&quot; subtitle on the cover.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Each of the 11 chapters introduces a programming project involving&nbsp;a 
		workable game.&nbsp; Each chapter&nbsp;provides practice with a progression 
		of&nbsp;features and capabilities of VC++ 2005 Express Edition. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; Use this book to learn how smoothly one can develop for 
		pure .NET 2.0 using Express Edition and you'll be fine.&nbsp; It's 
		introduction to the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) will also 
		be applicable to other forms of C/C++ software development. Think&nbsp;of 
		this as the 
														water-wings swimming 
														course that you might 
														want to complete before 
														going&nbsp;on to&nbsp;advanced 
														life-saving.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp; As of March 2006, this is the only book written specifically for 
		the Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition.&nbsp; The absence of simpler and 
		alternative books is in noticeable contrast to the extensive beginner support for C# and VB.NET.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

		<dt><a name="Petzold1999" target="_top" href="http://www.cpetzold.com">Petzold, Charles.</a> (1999)</dt>
		<dd><i>Programming Windows</i>, Fifth Edition.&nbsp; Microsoft Press 
		(Redmond, WA: 1999).&nbsp; ISBN 1-57231-995-X with CD-ROM.<small><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This &quot;10th anniversary edition&quot; is evidently the final 
		version of <i>Programming Windows</i> to use the native Windows API (and C 
		Language) for all of its explanation and examples.&nbsp;&nbsp; Petzold's 
		subsequent books feature managed code, C# Language, Windows Forms, and the 
		new foundations that accompany introduction of Windows Vista.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a requirement to operate with the Win32 API 
		and the Microsoft Platform SDK, this book is an important resource.&nbsp; 
		Petzold states three prerequisites for that approach (pp.3-4):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. 
		<b>Familiarity with Windows (98 or later) from an user's 
		perspective.</b>&nbsp; Carrying out all development on a Windows system 
		is a pre-requisite.&nbsp; Any machine that can run Visual C++ 2005 
		Express Edition satisfies this requirement.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. <b>Knowledge of C Language. 
		</b>&nbsp;&quot;If you don't know C, 
		Windows programming is probably not a good place to start.&nbsp; I 
		recommend that you learn C in a character-mode environment such as that 
		offered under the ... Command Prompt window.&quot;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. <b>32-bit C Compiler and Development Environment.</b>&nbsp; For 
		the few places where construction details are illustrated, Petzold 
		presumes Visual C++ 6.0 and also refers to Platform SDK versions that 
		were current at the same time.&nbsp; Adaptation for Visual C++ 2005 
		Express Edition and current Platform SDK versions is generally 
		straightforward.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </small></dd>

	<p><font color="#800080">{<b>AuthorNote:</b> For these and other resources, 
	I will look at providing some bridging starter material that shows how to 
	adapt what is in the book to working with Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition.&nbsp; 
	In some cases, such as (Miller &amp; Ford, 2006), I will gather any supplemental 
	material that provides a smoother start-up, if needed.&nbsp; I have no 
	desire to duplicate the extensive resources that are already available.&nbsp; 
	What I want to do is provide an useful foundation and guide for making use 
	of that great variety.</font></p>
	<p><font color="#800080">Also, for the Petzold prerequisites, we'll provide
