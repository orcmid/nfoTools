                      tion.  It is also provided for separate on-line
                      inspection.  This file is dated 2007-08-13-14:37
                      and is 9,171 bytes in size.

            float5.c  version 1.60 of the C Language program that shows
                      differences between decimal numeric values and the
                      internal floating-point values as stored and as
                      produced during computations.  This file is dated
                      2006-03-23-15:17 and is 9,832 bytes in size.

         float5a.exe  version of float5.c compiled using the Visual C++
                      2005 Express Edition optimizing compiler version
                      14.00.50727.42 for 80x86.  This file is dated
                      2006-03-23-15:21 and is 69,632 bytes in size.

         float5b.exe  version of float5.c compiled using default options
                      of the Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 compiler version
                      13.10.3077 for 80x86.  This file is dated 2006-
                      03-23-15:19 and is 45,056 bytes in size.

         float5c.exe  version of float5.c compiled with the /Za option
                      of the Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 compiler.  This
                      file is dated 2006-03-23-15:20 and is 45,056 bytes
                      in size.  It is different from float5b, even though
                      the files are of identical size.

2. TOOLS REQUIRED

   To access and use the material in this archive, the following resources
   are required:

       Internet Connection and Browser
                      for access to the material and download of the
                      t060301c.zip file.

       Zip-format archive access utility
                      The archive was produced with WinZip 9.0 SR-1 (6224)

       Utility for viewing or editing simple text files
                      Windows Notepad is sufficient.  No tabs are used
                      and word wrap should not be used in viewing. The
                      lines of text in the body are not wider than
                      80 characters.  Some mechanically-introduced lines
                      on the end may be wider; that is no barrier to
                      readability of the file.

       Microsoft Windows PC running Windows 98 SE or later.  This is
                      sufficient for executing the sample programs.  To
                      compile the sample program, the configuration
                      requirements of a C Language compiler must also
                      be met.

       C Language Compiler for optional compilation and modification of
                      the Float5.c demonstration program.  The program
                      has been compiled with Visual C++ 2005 Express
                      Edition and the Visual C++ Toolkit 2003 compilers.


3. INSTALLING THE MATERIAL FOR USE

   The programs are self-contained.  They are command-line programs.
   Extract them individually for execution in command-prompt sessions.

   The float5.c code can simply be viewed from the Zip file or moved to
   a location where it can be used with a compiler.

   An easy way to install the material is to place t060301c.zip in a
   directory where you want to use the files.  For example, place the
   Zip package in directory C:\MyProjects\float5\

   Extract the contents of t060301c.zip into the same directory.  This
   will make all of the files usable for demonstration and building
   your own versions.


4. USING THE MATERIAL

   You can open the float5.c file in Windows Notepad or in the IDE of
   a compiler system.

   You can execute the float5a.exe, float5b.exe, and float5c.exe
   programs from within a command prompt.  E.g., in Windows select

       Start | All Programs | Accessories | Command Prompt

   In the console window that opens, switch to the directory where
   you have the programs and execute one by name.  E.g.,

       C:\Documents and Settings\orcmid>cd C:\MyProjects\float5
       C:\MyProjects\float5>float5b

          [ the program runs ]

          [and when you are done executing commands ...]

       C:\MyProjects\float5>exit

   You can also incorporate float5.c in a Visual C++ 2005 Express
   Edition (or VS 2005) project:

       In the VC++ 2005 IDE, select menu File | Project | New

   On the New Project dialog (view t060301c1.png) select General project
   type and the Empty Project template.  A good name is simply "float5".
   Do not leave the check mark on "Create Directory for Solution."  This
   will make an empty float5 project directory.

   In the Solution Explorer pane, right-click on the Source Files folder
   of the float5 project (view t060301c2.png).  Select Add | Existing
   Item ... .  Browse to the location of your float5.c copy and select
   it into your project.

   VC++ 2005 uses the float5.c where you put it.  A copy is not actually
   made.  It is shown as part of your project just the same.  You can
   open float5.c in your VC++ 2005 IDE by double-clicking on the file
   in the Solution Explorer window.

   You can compile the program by using menu item Build | Build Solution
   (or press F7).  There should be no problems.  You can demonstrate the
   program using VC++ 2005 menu item Debug | Start Without Debugging
   (or press Ctrl+F5).  You should see the same results produced by
   program float5a.exe.

   demonstrate can be found by checking at web page

   and those linked from it may also provide additional tutorial
   information on the toolcraft of C/C++ programming generally and
   the Microsoft Visual C++ products in particular.
