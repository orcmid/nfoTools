                        NFOTOOLS SKILLS NOTEBOOK
                       --------------------------

    nfoTools docs/skills/ collection of folios on (tacit) skills that software
    developers rely upon, from reading, keyboarding, and computer operations
    that are part of computational fluency and reliable effort.  It is
    not exactly Computer Programming for Everyone (CP4E), not even Software
    Engineering for Everyone (SE4E), but tacit knowledge underies the
    competence presumed for users and the level of expectation among
    developers and producers of interesting software.

    Unspoken tacit knowledge is a barrier to neophytes and it is something
    that those who posess it don't even pause to notice they did not always
    have it themselves; it must be made visible to be learned.  It takes a
    beginner's mind to expose it.  Being thrown into the deep end of the pool
    as a way to learn to swim is not a great idea, especially for adults.

    The companion docs/tools/ articles rest on presumption or acquisition
    of various skills and awareness of their limitations. Skills are the
    prerequisites/companions for mastery of the tools.

    There are also skills related to cultural and social technologies, such
    as times and dates, calendars and locations, that are tacit and lead to
    intrinsic biases.  Then there is the matter of language and the overall
    encouragement of conceptual models that are embedded, or not,
    in technological efforts.  There may need to be identification of those
    assumptions, especially ones about language, location, and the past,
    present, and future.  These sources of friction need to be identified
    whether addressed or not.

TODO

 * Add "related-material" to notes on tacit knowledge and anything on gaining
   skills and confidence under other sections of nfoTools.

 * With regard to pre-requisites, we need to identify what they are and also
   provide a means to mastery of them. There is also something about UX
   guidance.

 * De-emphasize tacit knowledge and focus on skills pre-requisites and their
   satisfaction.  Add "on being a beginner."  Standard beginner mistakes.
   Introduce Confirmable Experience.

 * On Confirmable experience, and on providing mechanisms for encouraging it
   with novices.  Identify ways for beginners to report their difficulties,
   distinguish between requesting assistance and reporting a defect.  Also,
   discussions versus "Issues" and gleaning UX problems out of reported
   issues.

 * The home page should also help with this and maybe "About" too.

 * Address the prerequisite and companion skills that go with becoming fluent
   in the toolcraft featured in the nfoTools project.

 * Drawing and diagramming as a skill.  ASCII Art too.

 * The three R's as skills

 * Details of Windows 10/11 that users need to grasp in order to be able to
   lift the covers on software and programming

 * Need something about trial-and-error and not taking irreversible actions.

 * Need something about how we didn't learn things all at once and there needs
   to be an useful and also-tantalizing journey for a fruitful experience.

 * Need something on fear of failure and fear of ridicule, the ability to
   work in the open and with the scrutiny/contribution of others.

 * Elevate confirmable experience also, particularly in how to gain
   assistance and conduct trouble-shooting.

 * Make a bullet list of skills that are the kind that beginners need to
   be aware of and to cultivate.  Include keyboarding, file explorer usage,
   downloading and installing software, web browsing, screen capture

 * Need to look at English-first vs English-second, also accessibility and
   special access considerations.

 * Also supporting skills in others and learning technology details - when
   is getting into how keyboards work going too far down a rathole?

 * Create a connection to skills and tools from the entrance page.

 * Add on-ramp rerequisites and summaries/tutorials on file explorer, adding
   Git and GitHub support, downloading and installing software, zip usage,
   editing with Visual Studio Code, installing Visual Studio build tools,
   console operation (cmd.exe), and creating C/C++ software projects.

 * Need a skills inventory page for what I have in mind with regard to what
   becomes tacit more-or-less.  Some of this is about cases that are taken
   farther under tools.

 * Drawing and also pen-and-ink are also great cases of skills and also
   toolcraft.

 * Is an S000000 needed?

 * I was lying awake around 2021-10-14T13:00Z thinking about dates and
   calendars and the difficulties of dates in the past, and especially times
   in the relatively-recent past influenced by Daylight Savings time,
   something that messes up my older Outlook calendar pages depending on
   whether it is DST now or not, versus then.  Here is one treatment of the
   topic, <https://www.hcidata.info/cgi-bin/calendar.cgi>.  There is a
   problem with running calendars (and times) backwards, before times when
   a particular system went into effect.  This is rather overlooked in
   <https://exceluser.com/1057/how-to-work-with-dates-before-1900-in-excel/>.
   There is a name for running a date system back before the time it was
   introduced (in a given location!).  They are termed proleptic dates.  Here
   is a good article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar> with
   a terrific sidebar on different calendar systems.

 * Although unlikely to matter here, it occured to me that there is a problem
   with time-travel in any direction considering that the positions of the
   Earth and points on the surface of the Earth will have changed.  We then
   get into problems of coordinate systems and the (relative!) motions of
   planets and the solar system itself.  I can understand why this is not
   dealt with in science fiction and dramatizations of time travel.  And of
   course, fixed points on the Earth's surface are not all that fixed given
   significant time intervals.

 * Awareness of location systems and also time systems in astronomical terms
   are also significant as we talk about visiting more places away from the
   Earth's surface.  I wonder how that works for the International Space
   Station, and also on Mars now for rovers and later for human visitors.
