                     NFOTOOLS TACIT-SKILLS NOTEBOOK
                     ------------------------------

    nfoTools docs/skills/ collection of folios on tacit skills that software
    developers rely upon, from reading, keyboarding, and computer operations
    that are part of computational fluency and reliable effort.  It is
    not exactly Computer Programming for Everyone (CP4E), not even Software
    Engineering for Everyone (SE4E), but tacit knowledge underies the
    competence presumed for users and the level of expectation among
    developers and producers of interesting software.

    The unspoken tacit understanding is a barrier to those who have no insight
    and it is something that those who posess it don't even pause to notice
    they did not always have; it must be made visible to be learned.  It
    takes a beginner's mind to expose it.

    The companion docs/tools/ rests on the presumption or acquisition
    of various skills and awareness of their limitations. Skills are the
    prerequisites/companions for mastery of the tools.

TODO

 * Address the prerequisite and companion skills that go with becoming fluent
   in the toolcraft featured in the nfoTools project.

 * Drawing and diagramming as a skill.  ASCII Art too.

 * The three R's as skills

 * Keyboarding and the variety of keyboarding that goes with computer
   fluency

 * Details of Windows 10/11 that users need to grasp in order to be able to
   lift the covers on software and programming

 * Need something about trial-and-error and not taking irreversible actions.

 * Need something about how we didn't learn things all at once and there needs
   to be an useful and also-tantalizing journey for a fruitful experience.

 * Need something on fear of failure and fear of ridicule, the ability to
   work in the open and with the scrutiny/contribution of others.

 * The discussion about learning is getting very long on index.md and I need
   to work it over, maybe siphon much of it into a separate little essay.
