                     NFOTOOLS TACIT-SKILLS NOTEBOOK
                     ------------------------------

    nfoTools docs/skills/ collection of folios on tacit skills that software
    developers rely upon, from reading, keyboarding, and computer operations
    that are part of computational fluency and reliable effort.  It is
    not exactly Computer Programming for Everyone (CP4E), not even Software
    Engineering for Everyone (SE4E), but tacit knowledge underies the
    competence presumed for users and the level of expectation among
    developers and producers of interesting software.

    Unspoken tacit knowledge is a barrier to neophytes and it is something
    that those who posess it don't even pause to notice they did not always
    have it themselves; it must be made visible to be learned.  It takes a
    beginner's mind to expose it.  Being thrown into the deep end of the pool
    as a way to learn to swim is not a great idea, especially for adults.

    The companion docs/tools/ rests on the presumption or acquisition
    of various skills and awareness of their limitations. Skills are the
    prerequisites/companions for mastery of the tools.

TODO

 * Address the prerequisite and companion skills that go with becoming fluent
   in the toolcraft featured in the nfoTools project.

 * Drawing and diagramming as a skill.  ASCII Art too.

 * The three R's as skills

 * Keyboarding and the variety of keyboarding that goes with computer
   fluency

 * Details of Windows 10/11 that users need to grasp in order to be able to
   lift the covers on software and programming

 * Need something about trial-and-error and not taking irreversible actions.

 * Need something about how we didn't learn things all at once and there needs
   to be an useful and also-tantalizing journey for a fruitful experience.

 * Need something on fear of failure and fear of ridicule, the ability to
   work in the open and with the scrutiny/contribution of others.

 * Make a separate essay on tacit knowledge and how we all have it.

 * Elevate confirmable experience also, particularly in how to gain
   assistance and conduct trouble-shooting.

 * Make a bullet list of skills that are the kind that beginners need to
   be aware of and to cultivate.  Include keyboarding, file explorer usage,
   downloading and installing software, web browsing, screen capture

 * Need to look at English-first vs English-second, also accessibility and
   special access considerations.

 * Also supporting skills in others and learning technology details - when
   is getting into how keyboards work going too far down a rathole?

 * Create a connection to skills and tools from the entrance page.

 * Add on-ramp rerequisites and summaries/tutorials on file explorer, adding
   Git and GitHub support, downloading and installing software, zip usage,
   editing with Visual Studio Code, installing Visual Studio build tools,
   console operation (cmd.exe), and creating C/C++ software projects.

 * Need a skills inventory page for what I have in mind with regard to what
   becomes tacit more-or-less.  Some of this is about cases that are taken
   farther under tools.

 * Use the ADM-3A image to illustrate keyboard evolution.
   https://twitter.com/jschauma/status/1434265985138270210/photo/1
   Also find a Dvorak keyboard, and some manual, then electric, keyboards.
   These are all in English.  There needs to be more allowance for other
   variations, "dead" keys, etc.  But first, there is keyboarding, then
   keyboards.  A little here, about keyboarding and also tacit knowledge
   of the essential kind, and a lot about why this doesn't change, how
   far the "ASCII" keyboard has travelled.

 * Start a folio on keyboarding and tuck the ADM-3A image I saw there.
   Also need some historical things about keyboard technologies over time.
   A keypunch photo would be handy.  Code differences, holes in cards and
   paper tape, my oh my.
