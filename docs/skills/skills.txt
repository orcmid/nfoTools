                     NFOTOOLS TACIT SKILLS NOTEBOOK
                     ------------------------------

    nfoTools docs/ collection of folios on tacit skills that software
    developers rely upon, from reading, keyboarding to computer operation
    that are implicitly relied upon in developing computational fluency
    and reliable effort.  It is not exactly Computer Programming for
    Everyone (CP4E), not even Software Engineering for Everyone (SE4E), but
    underlying the competence presumed for users and the level that applies
    among developers and producers of interesting software.

    The companion treatment of tools rests on the presumption or acquisition
    of various skills and awareness of their limitations.

TODO

 * Address the prerequisite and companion skills that go with becoming fluent
   in the toolcraft featured in the nfoTools project.

 * Start a skills introductory page placeholder.  Could use the intentionally
   left blank, or the construction project symbol.  Just for funsies.

 * Drawing and diagramming as a skill.

 * The three R's as skills

 * Keyboarding and the variety of keyboarding that goes with computer
   fluency

 * Details of Windows 10/11 that users need to grasp in order to be able to
   lift the covers on software and programming

 * Need something about trial-and-error and not taking irreversible actions.

 * Need something about how we didn't learn things all at once and there needs
   to be an useful and also-tantalizing journey for a fruitful experience.

 * Need something on fear of failure and fear of ridicule, the ability to
   work in the open and with the scrutiny/contribution of others
