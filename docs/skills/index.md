# ***nfoTools** Tacit-Skills Notebook*

This topic is for identification of the various skills that software
developers master before those skills become tacit abilities and invisible
context of software effort, especially programming.

## Skills: The Importance of What We Know and Forgot We Learned It

Computer specialists and programmers, information-technology practitioners,
possess considerable tacit knowledge.  That's knowledge that is unspoken and
applied automatically without thought.  Sometimes we call it muscle memory.
It is ready-to-hand, always available, and effortless.

This section of ***nfoTools*** documentation is devoted to
unconcealing tacit knowledge among software developers, making its
prerequisite occurrence explicit and understood.

## The Skills Inventory

There's no escaping skill prerequisites.  Understanding what they are
may be helpful for preparation and development by the curious and patient.
Some can be practiced and exercised along with making software.

I invite discussion about all such skills, their development, and available
resources in the GitHub nfoTools project
[Discussion section](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/discussions).
Improvements and removal of defects in this particular documentation can be
reported and addressed in the
[Issues section](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/issues).
