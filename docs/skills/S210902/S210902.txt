                         KEYBOARDS AND KEYBOARDING
                         -------------------------

    This folio is about keyboarding as a prerequisite skill for developers
    as well as knowledge workers, other typists.

    The connection with muscle memory and and tacit skills matters.  The
    devotion of software developers to keyboards and rapid typing is a
    particular characteristic fascination over keyboards.

    There are also historical connections with the development of keyboards
    and also, when connected to computes, with how keyboard actions are
    delivered electronically and via computer operating systems.

TODO

 * Gather materials on keyboards and their usage, and learning keyboarding.

 * Create a place-holder page for starters.

 * Address tacit knowledge and how "muscle memory" applies to becoming adept
   with a keyboard.

 * Find a keypunch keyboard.  Maybe IBM 026 and also a Remington Rand one.
   There were also tiny round-holed arrangements for a short time.

 * Find a teletype or Friden keyboard.  We then get from punched cards to
   paper tape also.

 * Selectrics and diablo got to a different level, and often had use as
   terminals as well as dedicated word-processing functions, using floppies
   or magnetic tape.

 * Show variations of what are termed "ANSI" keyboards and also how that
   relates to keyboards with characters and codes for non-English use.

 * Keyboarding and the variety of keyboarding that goes with computer
   fluency

 * Use the ADM-3A image to illustrate keyboard evolution.

   Also find a Dvorak keyboard, and some manual, then electric, keyboards.
   These are all in English.  There needs to be more allowance for other
   variations, "dead" keys, etc.  But first, there is keyboarding, then
   keyboards.  A little here, about keyboarding and also tacit knowledge
   of the essential kind, and a lot about why this doesn't change, how
   far the "ASCII" keyboard has travelled.

 * Typing courses and how to do it.  Especially hand placement.  Assumptions
   about dexterity and how the hands work.

 * Start a folio on keyboarding and tuck the ADM-3A image I saw there.
   Also need some historical things about keyboard technologies over time.
   A keypunch photo would be handy.  Code differences, holes in cards and
   paper tape, my oh my.
