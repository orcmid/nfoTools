TODO

 * On Confirmable experience, and on providing mechanisms for encouraging it
   with novices.  Identify ways for beginners to report their difficulties,
   distinguish between requesting assistance and reporting a defect.  Also,
   discussions versus "Issues" and gleaning UX problems out of reported
   issues.

 * Elevate confirmable experience also, particularly in how to gain
   assistance and conduct trouble-shooting.


 * Drawing and also pen-and-ink are also great cases of skills and also
   toolcraft.  Recommend <https://www.gamedev.tv/p/complete-drawing> and
   maybe on Udemy?  Also point out that discounts become available.  Should
   wait for one of those.  This is relevant to being able to record and
   report some things.

 * Beginner Mind is a skill along with Confirmable Experience Capture.  So
   screen capture and ways to make the captures useful matters.

 * The creation of issue reports versus discussion, questions, and reporting
   are different and it takes skills to know the difference and to provide
   sufficient information and a way to supply more as requested.

 * The idea of confirmable experience is relevant, both in regard to
   explanation and also replication/confirmation of reports.

 * Gather historical discussion I have had around confirmable experience

 * Create a sub-folio for compilation of awesome CX failures.  Might need one
   for CX winners too.

 * The work of Alan Cooper expressed in "About Face" demonstrates a variety of
   UX and Interaction Design defects.  For CX, the idea is a little different
   but perhaps not orthogonal.  I have held onto "About Face 3."  I see such
   things as Considerate Products there.  I would not use such notions of
   computational agency, but we can all get the idea.  There's more to look
   into.

 * Trustworthiness and TROST figures in here also.

 * I mentioned that with regard to Jason's setup videos on Ableton Live (Lite)
   and how he didn't provide an experience users will see on their computers,
   especially PCs.  Around 2022-06-21 I had offered to make a PDF that handled
   the PC case.  I was interested in providing a confirmable experience, as
   I remarked to band on a regular Tuesday call.

   I sometimes offer “SE4E” as a counterpart of “CS4E.”  And a theme around
   that is “confirmable experience” and why screen capture is an important
   tool.  It helps crack through “works for me” sometimes.

 * 2019-07-05 Confirmable Experiences++ (from Band)
   Dennis, a couple of nice dog walks helped me sort out my thoughts from
   yours re confirmable experiences (CE). Here is my current description:
   2019-07-05: A CE is an experience that I have that I wish to convey to you
   and to confirm that you can have an identical (or similar?) experience.
   Technology breakdowns are good examples. When I run into a problem using a
   piece of technology I often want to know that I am not the only one having
   this particular problem. I wish to confirm that my breakdown is one that
   someone else can also experience. Such a confirmation might result in a
   software bug report and a subsequent software update. An inability for you
   to confirm my experience might suggest that the breakdown is in my actions
   or work practice or technology context or my understanding of how the
   particular feature or system works. Of course, my adoption or constuction
   of a misunderstanding of how an app or system works might also be viewed as
   a defect in the system. Not every user error is a result of user
   misunderstanding or knowledge or experience or competence; it might just be
   bad signage or form layout.

 * 2019-07-01 In reply to Band 2019-06-27 on McFadden paper.
   I think confirmable experience is about the ability to confirm something.
   For me, the classic example is mangling of a communication and the problem
   of over-coming the sender's works-for-me versus the recipient's experience.
   The challenge is how to make the experience of the recipient known to the
   sender.  There is, in addition, the issue of that being something that is
   actionable by the parties in some manner.
      An example we hard recently was how I showed up tinted green in a Skype
   video call.
   This gets complicated because there are intermediaries in these
   experiences, and we have no clue, generally, how they factor into the
   situation.
      I like the statement about mental models and Norman's perspective.   I
   am unclear, myself, whether that is a case that involves confirmable
   experience.  I suppose it might arise in the extent to which the system is
   encouraging (or affords) arrival at adequate mental models, and there are
   non-harmful ways for someone to test and confirm their mental model and
   especially breakdowns in its application.
      Oh, and not having you feel incompetent or frustrated when the system
   doesn't conform to your model.  And how to tell the difference between a
   system defect and a mental-model defect.
      Hmm ...

 * 2019-07-01 In reply to Band 2019-06-27 McFadden Paper ... experience 2
   I think the question is always what to make of a breakdown, and keeping
   systems workable for (most?) users.
      I agree, more thinking, and my previous reply might be helpful.   Maybe
   confirmable experience has to do with how one discerns the nature of the
   breakdown, and how the system supports that.
      I notice the examples we have tend to be around breakdowns.

 * 2019-06-27 Buddy Call Notes (think actually 06-25), I note that
   "BILL SENDS A NOTE about Confirmable Experience in the McFadden paper.
   Pretenses.  Semblances.  Interfaces with Dennis."  Here's the subsequent
   note.
   2019-06-27 McFadden paper: confirmable experience examples (from Band)
   "Dennis, here is one example of what I refer to as an example of a
   'confirmable experience” in the McFadden paper.  p. 94, first paragraph
   under “Good Models”, ends with this: '… the reasonable assumption that the
   purpose of a mental model “is to allow the person to understand and to
   anticipate the behavior of a physical system” (Norman, 1983, p.12).fn15.’
   I think of the idea of ‘confirmable experience’ as one that fits with some
   idea or expectation that I have of the behavior of a computer system in
   response to an action of mine, such as an input of keyboard strokes or a
   mouse button press or both. A breakdown occurs in my model (however fuzzy)
   of what is behind the screen or keyboard when my expectations are not met.
   I am not sure if this is how you use the phrase. Do we agree on this
   concept?"
   2019-06-27 McFadden paper: confirmable experience 2 (from Band) adds,
   "Dennis, on page 99, in the second paragraph there is this: 'Borgman (1986)
   has argued persuasively that users of complex interactive systems will, in
   spite of themselves, try to construct some kind of model or analogy to help
   them understand what is happen- ing to them. But they will not take the
   time and effort to articulate a good model of the system,even if they know
   what that might be; theyjust muddle along, never fitting the pieces
   together (p. 48). I have argued that using a mistaken metaphor for a target
   system will inevitably lead to incorrect conclusions about the current and
   future behavior of the system.'  Is this 'trying to construct some kind of
   model', but not making the 'effort to articulate a good model' also a
   characteristic of 'confirmable experiences'?  Yeah, this is pretty fuzzy.
   But maybe my experience is to come to some idea that, if it is confirmed by
   a subsequent interaction, I take to be good enough. And I only put more
   effort into coming up with a better idea when I have a breakdown. Hmmm ….
   I need to think about this more.
   [2023-07-09 On reviewing this material, I think there are two different
   considerations here.  One is having a conceptual model, another is making
   experiences confirmable, the latter also having different views between the
   actors.  For me, conceptual model is related to conceptual integrity, a
   term I have never forgotten since encountering it in the then-new Fred
   Brooks book, "The Mythical Man-Month."  To continue,]

  * 2017-12-06 RE: set theory & p->q (replying to Band)
    For some reason, the resolution of the image (only 31kb is a clue) is so
    low that I can't read it if I enlarge it to a readable size.  And if I use
    "actual size" it is all too small to read.
       Hey, a confirmable experience opportunity.
    [2023-07-09 This is all about communicating images and either not knowing
    or not checking how they will be viewable by a recipient with whom one
    wants to confirm/check/verify something.  In the above case, a JPEG of a
    book page came through as tiny and enlarging it in viewing software turned
    it into pixels before legibility.  I see this all the time when someone
    makes a screen capture which, including in an incident report, is actually
    unreadable.  I also was reading a Wordpress page where the in-line images
    were too small to be readable.  I usually provide blog page images in a
    form where the inserted image is also a link that brings up a full-size
    version of the image.  I did not know, until that incident, that I could
    have my browser save the image (in its raw form) to my computer's disk,
    and I could acess it in readable size from there.  That experience, and
    my exchange with the web page's author had me realize that a treatment of
    CX is overdue from me.]

   CONFIRMABLE EXPERIENCE
      I have two Symantec Certs that are up for renewal.  I ignored all the
   reminders until I was only a couple of days away.  I was careful to be
   certain which email addresses they were.
      Going to Symantec, I did the two ceremonies to obtain the two certs.
   Then, when the emails came for going through the actual connection and key
   generation, I did that.  In Internet Explorer 11, the key generation
   process failed because they couldn't find a crypto provider on my machine
   and I went through all kinds of things to allow ActiveX and it still didn't
   work.
      I finally quit and went back and did the process using Chrome instead.
   Worked without incident and perfectly.
      I then restored IE11 to my default security levels.

   2. Confirmable Experience -
      Symantec no long has continuity among certificates, so doesn't know what
      I may have already renewed.
         Transferring domain DNS records around is a great mystery.  Dennis
      turned in an A2 Hosting support ticket to get help on this.

 * 2015-02-21 Confirmable Experiences Are Us (by Dennis) and long
   I just realized that the 2.5 hours on the phone with Microsoft Office 365
   support yesterday is a giant "confirmable experience" breakdown.  The
   attention from the first-line supporter was great, although it took a while
   for me to understand that to switch from Office 365 Small Business Premium
   to Office 365 Business was by switching to Office 365 Business Essentials
   and then upgrading from that one.  (The web dashboard does not provide a
   direct switch and I was totally unwilling to renew a $150 subscription for
   another year when the $99 one is now available to the public.)
      I had to confirm my understanding all the way through the conversation
   and I could have listened more and not kept putting in that I wanted to
   keep continuity in my Office Desktop software, especially Outlook.  The
   referral to 2nd-line support happened because the dashboard I had as a
   result was not the same as the one she saw, or she simply failed to tell
   me that I was supposed to click on a link to get to the one she was seeing.
      The time with the 2nd-line support (at least an hour) might have been
   shorter, but I declined to allow remote-assistance access and I am pretty
   certain I have disabled the feature.  It turns out a plain uninstall of
   Office is not good enough and there is a Fixit that must be downloaded and
   run to do it.  Then the over-the-web install of the flavor of Office that
   is registered for Office 365 Business works (and takes another long time).
   It was a nail-biter until I saw that Outlook came up just the same as I had
   left it before starting all of this over the phone.
      I was reminded of the "confirmable experience" bit because
   keybase.io/orcmid reported earlier this morning that it can no longer
   verify the proof that I stored at http://worthiness.org.  I expected that,
   since I no longer have a Sharepoint site in my new O365 subscription and
   the domain no longer resolves.  Now I need to go do all the DNS magic to
   point that domain name, which I own, to a place on my A2 Hosting web
   service, where there are already pages waiting for it.  Then I can do
   another proof.  Meanwhile, worthiness.org is no longer on my list of
   confirmed sites at <http://keybase.io/orcmid>.  I think I'll put that off
   a few days until I complete some other backlog items.

   The ... problem is the fact that the Package Manager used by MSYS2 checks a
   keyring and signatures on the packages it downloads to install.  But
   apparently, my having gpg2 in my search path (set by GPG4Win) is causing a
   conflict.  Unfortunately, I need that path entry for keybase.io when
   running it under my local node.js.
      Confirmable Experience.  We gots Confirmable Experience, yes we do.
      Since MSYS2 runs native Windows console apps, I suspect there can be
   more conflicts like this, between native utilities and ones of the same
   names that are custom to MSYS2 and search-path problems.  I am asking for
   where this is documented.  Also, the MSYS2 wiki page on installing MSYS2 is
   not current and doesn't address these situations.

   ... SharePoint is one of those places where Microsoft violates the "no

      My Office 365 Small Business Pro Admin Dashboard has a link for "Office"
   to Download the latest version of Office, and other desktop, phone, and
   tablet apps.  I went there for some other curious reason, and saw that
   panel for controlling my installations of Office 2013 also included a link
   for "Tools & add-ins."  I clicked that out of curiosity.  The only thing
   listed there is a way to Install SharePoint Designer.  There is a one-line
   description.  I installed it just to see what it was.  And, voila, nosing
   around I realized it showed me the root of my SharePoint instance and it
   let me add the keybase.txt file there.

   3. Keybase.io - some odd documentation about signature/hash chains in the
   docs.  This stuff is tough.  I am still working around the care and feeding
   of a key pair.  This other stuff is monstrously geeky.  I have had fun
   explaining how to annotate a detached signature, though:

   [2023-07-09 There is a thing here about how to check this stuff and also
   how to create digitally-signed materials.  I did more on this I need to
   recover and employ as part of a separate skill/tool treatment.  There is
   also a trick beside annotation of detached signatures and I need to
   recover that.  Also, the above URL may become defunct at some time and I
   need to grab what is needed for the general topic and preservation via
   Github.  I've parked a copy here for the time-being.]
