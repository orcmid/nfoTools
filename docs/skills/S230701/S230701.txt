TODO

 * On Confirmable experience, and on providing mechanisms for encouraging it
   with novices.  Identify ways for beginners to report their difficulties,
   distinguish between requesting assistance and reporting a defect.  Also,
   discussions versus "Issues" and gleaning UX problems out of reported
   issues.

 * Elevate confirmable experience also, particularly in how to gain
   assistance and conduct trouble-shooting.


 * Drawing and also pen-and-ink are also great cases of skills and also
   toolcraft.  Recommend <https://www.gamedev.tv/p/complete-drawing> and
   maybe on Udemy?  Also point out that discounts become available.  Should
   wait for one of those.

 * Beginner Mind is a skill along with Confirmable Experience Capture.  So
   screen capture and ways to make the captures useful matters.

 * The creation of issue reports versus discussion, questions, and reporting
   are different and it takes skills to know the difference and to provide
   sufficient information and a way to supply more as requested.

 * The idea of confirmable experience is relevant, both in regard to
   explanation and also replication/confirmation of reports.
