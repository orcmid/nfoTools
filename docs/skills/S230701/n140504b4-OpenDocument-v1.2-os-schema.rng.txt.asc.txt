         OpenDocument-v1.2-os-schema.rng DETACHED SIGNATURE
         ==================================================

    This file is a detached digital signature for the file with
    the same name absent the *.asc suffix.

    To verify this signature, place both files in a single
    directory.  The file to be checked must not be altered
    in any manner and it should be downloaded directly
    from its source.

    If the file to be checked has been renamed, rename this
    signature file to match, with the addition of *.asc
    suffix.

    To verify the signature using GnuPG, import a copy of the
    OpenPGP Public Key of the signer from <http://keybase.io/orcmid>,
    from <https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc>,
    or from a PGP Key Server.  The fingerprint of the key is
    04D0 4322 979B 84DE 1077  0334 F96E 89FF D456 628A.

    Verification is by opening a console session in the same
    directory as the pair of files.  Verify the signature by
    simply executing the command

    > gpg n140504b3-OpenDocument-v1.2-os-schema.rng.txt.asc

    using the name given to this file if it has been renamed.

    To verify that the signed replica is a faithful copy of the
    official OASIS OpenDocument-v1.2-os-schema.rng file,
    download a copy of that file from the OASIS soure at
    <http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/os/>.  Rename this
    signature file to match the name of the downloaded file
    and perform the gpg command using the renamed detached
    signature file.

    THE CLAIM:

    File n140504b3-OpenDocument-v1.2-os-schema.rng.txt.asc
    provided at <http://nfoworks.org/notes/2014/05/n140504-cache/>
    is an accurate copy of the official OASIS file.  This claim
    establishes a chain of custody with regard to the derivation
    of annotated replicas of the official schema.

    Demonstration of the claim is by confirmation that the same
    OpenPGP signature file is verifiable against either source of
    the signed file.
