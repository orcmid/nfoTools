                      NFOTOOLS DEVELOPMENT NOTEBOOK
                      -----------------------------

    nfoTools docs/dev/ collection of folios on specific development efforts
    and the preserved releases.  There's a chronological arrangement with
    version progressions and a catalog.

    These are all about building.  Because there is also material on GitHub
    where the development is source-managed, there is a certain division
    of labor.  There is capture of nfoWorks.org and nfoWare.com retroactive
    items.  The organization of folders allows for the progressive
    availability of versions.

TODO

 * Replicate the nfoware.com/dev/ structure and purpose as well as possible.

 * Migrate materials here so that downloads can be obtained from here and
   information about and in them point to nfoTools instead of nfoware.com.

 * This will come with clean-up of devKits in the orcmid/nfoTools repositiory.

 * Create index.md placeholder for subsequent expansion as some existing
   dev notes are migrated from sites being deprecated.

 * Bring VCbind d161101 here so that a new VCbind that update without changes
   can reference D161101 here.  It is the poster-child for how to do the
   progression of versions.

 * Create a project on d151101 migration, having it be practice for a
   W3C-style progression and its historical preservation.
