                    DEV: NFOTOOLS DEVELOPMENT NOTEBOOK
                    ----------------------------------

    nfoTools docs/dev/ collects folios on specific development efforts
    and their preserved releases.  There's a chronological arrangement with
    version progressions and a catalog.

    These are all about building of nfoTools internals and their availability
    for tooling of other projects.  The developments are source-code managed
    on GitHub and the documentation and releases of those developments are
    here.

    There is also capture of nfoWorks.org and nfoWare.com retroactive
    items.  The organization of folders allows for the progressive
    availability of all versions and their history, modelled on a practice of
    the W3C19:56Z Review and manage TODOs.

TODO

 * Replicate the nfoware.com/dev/ structure and purpose as well as possible.

 * Migrate materials here so that downloads can be obtained from here and
   information about and in them point to nfoTools instead of nfoware.com.

 * This will come with clean-up of devKits in the orcmid/nfoTools repositiory.

 * Create a project on d161101 migration, having it be practice for a
   W3C-style progression and its historical preservation.

 * Create a folio for the conCheck application and its operation.

 * Adjust to align with the title of D211101 now that it is started.

 * Triage the nfoWare dev folder and others

 * Redo the folio-page title strips to have the desired form that will be
   preserved when authoring is separated from staged publishing.

 * Create a folio on the formatting and other conventions applicable to the
   participation in nfoTools development efforts (a.k.a coding standards)
