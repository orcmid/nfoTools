                    DEV: NFOTOOLS DEVELOPMENT NOTEBOOK
                    ----------------------------------

    nfoTools docs/dev/ collects folios on specific development efforts
    and their preserved releases.  There's a chronological arrangement with
    version progressions and a catalog.

    These are all about building of nfoTools internals and their availability
    for tooling of other prjects.  The developments are source-code managed on
    GitHub and the documentation of those developments are here.

    There is also capture of nfoWorks.org and nfoWare.com retroactive
    items.  The organization of folders allows for the progressive
    availability of all versions and their history.

TODO

 * Replicate the nfoware.com/dev/ structure and purpose as well as possible.

 * Migrate materials here so that downloads can be obtained from here and
   information about and in them point to nfoTools instead of nfoware.com.

 * This will come with clean-up of devKits in the orcmid/nfoTools repositiory.

 * Create a project on d161101 migration, having it be practice for a
   W3C-style progression and its historical preservation.

 * Create a folio for the conCheck application and its operation.

 * Adjust to align with the title of D211101 now that it is started.

 * Triage the nfoWare dev folder and others

 * Add D211101/ to the docs/dev/index.md page when there is something
   to find using the Internet.
