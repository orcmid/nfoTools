             VCRAYAPP: VC/C++ COMMAND-LINE RAYLIB APP DEVKIT
             -----------------------------------------------

VCrayApp consists of a Zip package for a software construction set to simplify
command-line compiling of C/C++ language programs using Microsoft Windows
developer tools and the raysan5/raylib library for graphical applications.
VCrayApp is delivered in a form that can be confirmed for correct
operation before customization as part of a specific project.

TODO

 * Dig into devKits/WinDev/VCrayApp for more material and explanations here.

 * Refine with more internet browsable information and linked materials.

 * Verify hashes and signatures and document how it is done.

 * Appeal to skills and toolcraft on handling hashes and signatures, when
   available.

 * Distinguish between using a VCrayApp kit found in a distribution one is
   using versus incorporation in a distribution one is producing.  There
   is also the middle case, inserting a VCrayApp kit in a project one wants
   to work on (a clone of).  This is beyond testing and deployment though.
   This is customization.  Need to ponder that.  Be emphatic in the D211101d
   and D211101e subfolios.

 * Add link to T211002 on Visual Studio Native Build Tools and eventually
   have more on the VC/C++ compiler usage at that place, or a new Toolnote

 * Add link to T211102 on Git and GitHub and having more on that case.
   Those could be supplements.

 * Add link to T211001 on Visual Studio Code.  Be certain to add a link to
   the documentation <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs> and maybe need to
   emphasize some things about trusted repositories.

 * Add D211101 to the title of index.md

 * Update status on the docs/dev/index.md page.

 * Add D211101e to D211101 available materials when release is imminent and
   the next official release (4.6?) is made for raylib and confirmed.

 * Emphasize that the "must be modified" applies to standalone project usage.

 * Set up D21101e for targetting by links from VCrayApp materials, including
   explanation of error messages.

 * Determine whether there is a detached signature for VCrayApp.bat and also
   for anything in the cache.  This is probably unnecessary and we have to
   deal with the fact that many of the cache\*.opt files may be modified but
   ideally not VCrayApp.bat itself.  Mmm, except for %VCRAYEXE% and that will
   immediately break any signature.

 * Embedded use should be an advanced topic related to lifecycle management
   and such considerations.  This is moderately acute when VCrayApp is
   embedded in a distribution, such as VCrayVerify.

 * Update the Usage message.  Maybe reflect that it is from 0.1.0.  Also,
   use a screen capture.

 * Update the NOTE on section 2.

 * Mention "recent" raylib source-code release.  This business is also
   important with respect to life-cycle.

 * There needs to be some links on using Windows File Explorer.  Something
   general around usage by/for developers.

 * Use of the built-in Zip also needs to be described better elsewhere.

 * Use of the VC/C++ Command Line Compiler also needs a general tools place.

 * Link to Visual Studio Code.

 * Link to TortoiseGit tool.

 * Link to Git4Win and other Git materials.

 * Link to GitHub Windows Client for additional information.  Feature that
   this is not required, and Git can be used directly as a command-line
   utility.

 * Link to GPG4Win and other generic GPG materials.

 * Establish that this material is effective as of, and applicable, to the
   0.1.0 (beta) release of VCrayApp.

 * Add fails/ to the Available Materials.

 * Mention libs as a prospect in the cache but not in src\*.c because we don't
   have a good way to parse that or any alternative %VCAPPSRC% value.  So the
   only place for foreign libs is cache, which rather makes sense.

 * Create a demo project that is at a higher place in the file hierarchy and
   redo everything from there.  Use that for all of the screen captures.

 * The creation of shortcuts and customized properties for the Developer
   Command Prompt needs to be introduced in some manner.
