   Hamilton, Dennis E. VCrayApp: VC/C++ Command-Line raylib App devKit.
   nfoTools development text file D211101.txt version 0.0.9 dated 2023-01-12,

TODO

 * Migrate materials here so that downloads can be obtained from here and
   nfoTools locations can be pointed to for further information.

 * Dig into devKits/WinDev/VCrayApp for more material and explanations here.

 * Get an alpha release over here raw and refine over here in terms of
   Internet browsable information and linked materials.

 * Create and verify hashes and signatures

 * Appeal to skills and toolcraft on handling hashes and signatures, when
   available.

 * Distinguish between using a VCrayApp kit found in a distribution one is
   using versus incorporation in a distribution one is producing.  There
   is also the middle case, inserting a VCrayApp kit in a project one wants
   to work on (a clone of).

 * Ensure that the index.html pages are in the title blocks too

 * Update D211101d available materials with release status

 * Change D211101c to be about usage, testing, and development
