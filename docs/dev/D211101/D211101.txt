           VCRAYAPP: VC/C++ COMMAND-LINE RAYLIB APP BUILD KIT
           --------------------------------------------------

VCrayApp consists of a Zip package that can be included in a software
construction set to simplify command-line compiling of C/C++ language programs
using Microsoft Windows developer tools and the raysan5/raylib library for
graphical applications.  VCrayApp is easily deployed within GitHub-carried
projects.  It is delivered in a form that can be confirmed for correct
operation before customization as part of a specific project.
  
PRINCIPLES

* Operation with freely-available and free-to-use development tools.
* Simple manual instructions for free-standing use and for incorporation
  in construction sets designed for novice usage.
* Sufficient for incorporation inside more-elaborate construction sets.
* Designed for confirmation of operation and confident employment.
* Safe for novice developers and others keen to develop games and graphical
  applications on Windows for Windows using freely-available tools.

PLAN

* Develop VCrayApp on GitHub as part of the nfoTools project.
* Provide pilot demonstration in confirmation of raylib examples
* Release alpha and beta versions for confirmation and early-adopter trial
* Confirm in prototype WinCon Construction Sets
* Include confirmation materials and approaches.
* Deal with levels of prerequisite and progressive disclosure
* Address life-cycle issues with respect to VCrayApp and interdependency with
  raylib releases
* Address usage with raylib work-in-progress for raylib contributors

TODO

 * Migrate materials here so that downloads can be obtained from here and
   information about and in them point to nfoTools.

 * This will come with clean-up in the orcmid/nfoTools/devKits repository.

 * Dig into devKits/WinDev/VCrayApp for more material and explanations here.

 * Get an alpha release over here raw and refine over here in terms of
   Internet browsable information and linked materials.

 * Create and verify hashes and signatures

 * Appeal to skills and toolcraft on handling hashes and signatures, when
   available.

 * Distinguish between using a VCrayApp kit found in a distribution one is
   using versus incorporation in a distribution one is producing.  There
   is also the middle case, inserting a VCrayApp kit in a project one wants
   to work on a clone of.
