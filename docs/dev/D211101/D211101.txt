   Hamilton, Dennis E. VCrayApp: VC/C++ Command-Line raylib App devKit.
   nfoTools development text file D211101.txt version 0.0.2 dated 2022-08-16,
   available on the Internet as a version of
   <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/D211101.txt>

TODO

 * Migrate materials here so that downloads can be obtained from here and
   nfoTools locations can be pointed to for further information.

 * Dig into devKits/WinDev/VCrayApp for more material and explanations here.

 * Get an alpha release over here raw and refine over here in terms of
   Internet browsable information and linked materials.

 * Create and verify hashes and signatures

 * Appeal to skills and toolcraft on handling hashes and signatures, when
   available.

 * Distinguish between using a VCrayApp kit found in a distribution one is
   using versus incorporation in a distribution one is producing.  There
   is also the middle case, inserting a VCrayApp kit in a project one wants
   to work on (a clone of).

 * Add D211101a/ for VCrayApp Setup

 * Add D211101b/ for VCrayApp Operation

 * Ensure that the index.html pages are in the title blocks too
