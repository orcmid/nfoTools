   Hamilton, Dennis E. D211101a: VCrayApp Setup.  nfoTools development
   documentation text file D211101a.txt version 0.0.4 dated 2023-11-22,
   available on the Internet as a version of
   <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/a/D211101a.txt>

TODO

 * Bring the illustrated setup description here as sufficient for 0.1.0.

 * Provide details for beta usage by a careful novice or better

 * Screen capture the downloads, using VCrayApp 0.1.0 (from D211101e).

 * Demonstrate install of a raylib source and having VS Build Tools to run.

 * Demonstrate the verifications of VCrayApp-0.1.0.txt and VCrayApp-0.1.0.zip
   This requires some toolcraft on the checking of digital signatures and the
   checking of hashes.

 * There needs to be a hash-check utility that works better.

 * Demonstrate the unzipping of VCrayApp with raylib\ nearby on the same drive

 * Demonstrate the initial confirmation of the setup

 * Feature the prerequisite setups: Having chosen a place for VCrayApp
   projects, installing Visual Studio Built Tools, and installing raylib
   releases.

 * Recommend holding onto a source-release .zip file.

 * Provide tips for novices but don't get in the way of more-experienced
   developers.  Identify tips and also provide links to specialized materials.
   I may need a tool folio on raylib soon.

 * Identify the VCrayApp version that this information is current with.
