VCrayApp is a Zip package for a folder to be used in creating a Microsoft
Windows program using the `raysan5/raylib` library for graphical applications.
VCrayApp is easily incorporated in  GitHub-carried projects.  The initial
VCrayApp setup includes confirmation of correct operation that can then be
confidently customized for a new project.

## Principles

* Operation with freely-available and free-to-use development tools.
* Simple manual instructions for free-standing use and for incorporation
  in projects designed for novice and advanced usage.
* Sufficient for incorporation inside more-elaborate construction sets.
* Designed for confirmation of operation and confident employment.
* Safe for novice developers and others keen to develop games and graphical
  applications on native Windows.

## Plan

* Develop VCrayApp on GitHub as part of the nfoTools project.
* Provide pilot demonstration in confirmation of raylib examples
* Release alpha and beta versions for confirmation and early-adopter trial
* Include confirmation materials and approaches.
* Deal with levels of prerequisite and progressive disclosure
* Address life-cycle issues with respect to VCrayApp and interdependency with
  raylib releases
* Address usage with raylib work-in-progress for raylib contributors
