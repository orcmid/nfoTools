VCrayApp consists of a Zip package that can be included in a software
development project to simplify command-line compiling of C/C++ language
programs for Microsoft Windows that use the raysan5/raylib library for
graphical applications.  VCrayApp is easily deployed within GitHub-carried
projects.  It is delivered in a form that can be confirmed for correct
operation before customization as part of a specific project.

## Principles

* Operation with freely-available and free-to-use development tools.
* Simple manual instructions for free-standing use and for incorporation
  in projects designed for novice usage.
* Sufficient for incorporation inside more-elaborate construction sets.
* Designed for confirmation of operation and confident employment.
* Safe for novice developers and others keen to develop games and graphical
  applications on Windows for Windows using freely-available tools.

## PLAN

* Develop VCrayApp on GitHub as part of the nfoTools project.
* Provide pilot demonstration in confirmation of raylib examples
* Release alpha and beta versions for confirmation and early-adopter trial
* Include confirmation materials and approaches.
* Deal with levels of prerequisite and progressive disclosure
* Address life-cycle issues with respect to VCrayApp and interdependency with
  raylib releases
* Address usage with raylib work-in-progress for raylib contributors
