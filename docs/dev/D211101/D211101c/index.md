# TOMBSTONE

This sub-folio was originally intended to always have the page for the
latest VCrayApp release.

There is no such page in the structure of technical folios at
[nfoTools](orcmid.github.io/nfoTools).

To learn what the next and latest releases following a known one are,
examine the version information block in the table at the heading of the
page for a known releasse, such as for
[VCrayApp-0.0.0](https://orcmid.guthub.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/D211101d).
