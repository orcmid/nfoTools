# PLACEHOLDER: CONTENT TBD

VCbind 0.1.0 was released on 2016-11-25 at
[nfoWare d161101c](https://nfoware.com/dev/2016/11/d161101c.htm).  That
location will be retired.  The release is preserved here.

This release is deprecated. It contains signed materials that refer to
locations at `nfoware.com` instead of here at Github Project
`orcmid/nfoTools`.

Improved documentation will be provided with the superseding VCbind 0.1.1
release.

For more about this material and the [toolcraft](../../../tools/) dependencies
on Zip, PGP, and SHA256, consult the [overview document](../) and descriptions
of later supported releases.

The unpacked `VCbind.zip` is intended for
[Command Prompt](../../../tools/T060501/) setup of a command-line environment
ready for use of Microsoft Windows native C/C++ development tools.

## VCbind 0.1.0 Preservation Integrity Confirmation

Confirmation that the files have been preserved intact from their previous
download location is accomplished using already-installed gpg4Win software,
including the Kleopatra tool. Details are [toolcraft](../../../tools/).

Verification of the `VCbind.zip` digital signature in `VCbind.zip.asc` is
by double-clicking on the `.asc` file.

![Clicking VCbind.zip.asc](D161101c1-Explorer.png)

Kleopatra is launched and the signature is reported as verified.

![VCbind.zip Signature verification](D161101c2-VCbind.zip.asc-Kleopatra.png)

In the same manner, the `VCbind-0.1.0-src.zip` signature is verified.

![VCbind-0.1.0-src.zip Signature verification](D161101c3-VCbind-src.zip.asc-Kleopatra.png)

The file `VCbind-0.1.0.txt` is signed with a Cleartext
signature.  That is also verifiable using the Kleopatra tool.

![Kleopatra Verification Option](D161101c4-Kleopatra-VerifyOption.png)

The `VCbind-0.1.0.txt` selection is made in response to Kleopatra.

![Kleopatra VCbind 0.1.0 selection](D161101c5-Kleopatra-Select-VCbind-0.1.0.txt.png)

Verification is confirmed.  It is unnecessary to save a stripped unsigned
copy.

Although the signatures provide the strongest verification for the integrity
of the downloaded files to their D161101c location, there are also SHA256
hashes that can be confirmed.  These verify that the files have not been
altered since the hashes were derived.  This can be done on Windows using
Command Prompt operations.  The hashes are derived for visual comparison with
the values in the `.sha256` files.

![Hash Checks](D161101c7-HashChecks.png)

To replicate the signature verifications, obtain the signer's public key with
fingerprint `04D0 4322 979B 84DE 1077  0334 F96E 89FF D456 628A`.  That can
be downloaded at [Apache Key for Orcmid](http://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc).
