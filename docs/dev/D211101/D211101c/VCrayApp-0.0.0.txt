           BUILDING RAYLIB APPS WITH VS DEVELOPER COMMAND PROMPT
           -----------------------------------------------------

PLACEHOLDER: This is a placeholder until VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip is prepared.  This
    placeholder will be replaced by the official VCrayApp-0.0.0.txt at that
    time.

  *                              CAUTION                                *
  *                              *******                                *
  *                                                                     *
  *    This is an alpha release of VCrayApp.  There is incomplete       *
  *    information.  Alpha is intended for review and testing of the    *
  *    functionality.  It requires more self-reliance than expected     *
  *    of novice developers.  The purpose is gathering feedback from    *
  *    trial use.  There will be beta releases followed by stable       *
  *    releases.  There may be breaking changes in that progression.    *
  *    Be cautious.  Be careful.  Here be dragons.                      *
  *                                                                     *
  *                             IMPORTANT                               *
  *                             *********                               *
  *                                                                     *
  *    No VCrayApp support is provided for development using anything   *
  *    but the C languages and the Microsoft VC C/C++ compiler and      *
  *    related developer tools on a Windows PC, desktop or laptop.      *
  *                                                                     *
  *    VCRAYAPP 0.0.0 IS BEING TESTED WITH THE RAYLIB 3.7.0 SOURCE      *
  *    CODE.  THERE ARE POSSIBLE DIFFICULTIES WITH RAYLIB 4.0.0 BECAUSE *
  *    OF BREAKING CHANGES IN THAT RELEASE AND SUBSEQUENT ACTIVITY.     *
  *    CONFIRMATION WITH 4.0.0 AND LATER RELEASES IS FUTURE WORK.       *
  *                                                                     *                                                                     *
  *    Ramon Santiago's raylib software is written in a clean-form of   *
  *    the C Language.  Use of the raylib code, include files, and the  *
  *    API interfaces requires confidence in the use of the C or C++    *
  *    languages with such libraries. VCrayApp is intended to be used   *
  *    directly only for programs written in the C Language.            *
  *                                                                     *
  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    The VCrayApp-0.0.0 distribution is available on the web at
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/D211101c>.  Consult
    that page for the latest status, links to useful related material,
    and the most-recent version.  If there is concern for the authenticity
    or correctness of any VCrayApp distribution, obtain a full replacement
    at <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101>.

    VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip delivers a Windows folder and batch script for setting
    up development of Windows native graphical applications. The raylib of
    Ramon Santiago is used <https://www.raylib.com/>.  VCrayApp is useful for
    developing self-contained computer games and similar applications.

    To use VCrayApp, you will need to use the Windows File Explorer, to
    navigate and operate with the Windows Command Shell, cmd.exe, and to
    operate with Windows Batch (.bat) script files.

    VCrayApp is designed to work with versions of Visual Studio that are free
    for personal use, including the Visual Studio Build Tools (recommended)
    and the Visual Studio Community editions.  Additional levels of Visual
    Studio can also be used, all via their Native Tools Command Prompt.
