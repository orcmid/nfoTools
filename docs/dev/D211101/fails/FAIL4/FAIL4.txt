      VCRAYAPP FAILCODE4: COMPILING CACHE OF RAYLIB FILES FAILED
      ----------------------------------------------------------

    This FAILCODE is difficult to encounter.  It is even difficult to force.

    There needs to be division between two different cases:

     1. There is install of a recent version of raylib/ later than 4.5 that
        has an incompatibility with VCrayApp.  This will tend to be a case
        of a missing or failing component.

     2. This also can happen becase of a build-breaking change in an
        in-progress -dev version being installed.  In that case, the break
        might be in one of the externals that has introduced the failure
        situation.

     3. Alterations of *.opt files can also lead to failures.

    What we know did work is that

     o VCrayVerCheck.c compiled correctly and accessed raylib\src\raylib.h
       without difficulty.
     o VCrayVer.bat was produced correctly.  It can also be accessed to see
       what was determined with VCrayVerCheck.c.
     o cache\raylibCode.opt was set and it can be examined to see if it is
       compatible wth the version installed at raylib\.
     o cache\*.obj files can reveal which ones, if any, were successfully
       produced before the failure.
     o As the sources are compiled in the verbose list, it should be clear
       where the failure is occuring.  If there are any changes to the
       reported parameters, the related *.opt files and the command line
       should be restored, either by re-unzipping or reverting individual
       changes.
     o There should be compiler error messages that can be reviewed for
       determination of where the failure occured.  If necessary, rerun the
       VCrayApp in verbose (absence of "*" option) mode to see the compile
       log.
     o We are not going to get into that.  We need a link for how to handle
       compiler diagnostics and getting details of the build problems in
       the identified code locations.

TODOS:

 * Appeal to FAIL5 for how to fix this kind of thing if it actually happens.

 * Proof-read and make the contrivance of the message clear.

 * Indicate this is a counterpart of FAIL5 except that there is no linking
   and difficulties may be related to raylib, rather than ones ruled out at
   this point.

 * Confirm that there is little or no failure information in this case.

 * An option for here should be to also check raylib and nfoTools issues for
   any known difficulties.

 * As cases become known, if ever, there can be comments here and in the FAIL
   account.
