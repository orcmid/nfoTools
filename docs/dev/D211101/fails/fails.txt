                 VCRAYAPP: FAILURE-MESSAGE EXPLANATIONS
                 --------------------------------------

VCrayApp consists of a Zip package for a software construction set to simplify
command-line compiling of C/C++ language programs using Microsoft Windows
developer tools and the raysan5/raylib library for graphical applications.
VCrayApp is delivered in a form that can be confirmed for correct
operation before customization as part of a specific project.

TODO

 * There needs to be non-failure advisory-message explanations also.  Those
   might be under the individual D211101a-c pages.

 * Do not over-explain when there are generic matters, such as how to handle
   compiler error and warning messages, what the parameters of builds are
   about, and so on.  Generic/comprehensive materials may belong in other
   places.  So there will be TODOs at other locations on required support of
   a more-general nature.

 * Create a folio for each FAILCODE and Connect it to the fails\index.md
   o Create FAIL3 coverage
   o Create FAIL4 coverage
   o Create FAIL5 coverage
   o Create FAIL6 coverage
   o Create FAIL7 coverage
   o Create FAIL8 coverage

 * Point out that the screen captures are verbose (or not) versions.
   o Check FAIL0 and correct for this as needed
   o Check FAIL1 and correct for this as needed

 * Should we show both flavors when they differ?  YES, because the quieter
   ones show up in embedded cases.

 * Projects should link to the Classic Projects being used.
   <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/projects?type=classic>

 * Connect to FAIL2
