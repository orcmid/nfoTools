TODO

 * we need a folio for failure messages.  D21101/fails/ is the choice.  The
   failure messages will be one level down.  E.g.,
   <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/fails/FAIL1>.  There is
   a folder for each one and fails/ provides an index to them.  In this case,
   FAIL .bat message names cannot be reused.  A significant change to a
   message requires use of a new name.

 * The use of subfolders is in order to have assets on an individual message
   explanation, along with links to other materials, their own manifests,
   etc.

 * Create a index.md on the folio pattern for fails just like other content.

 * There needs to be non-failure advisory-message explanations also.  Those
   might be under the individual D211101a-c pages.

 * Do not over-explain when there are generic matters, such as how to handle
   compiler error and warning messages, what the parameters of builds are
   about, and so on.  Generic/comprehensive materials may belong in other
   places.  So there will be TODOs at other locations on required support of
   a more-general nature.

 * Expand the manifest for the FAILn folios.
