      VCRAYAPP FAILCODE1: INCORRECT VCrayApp FILES CONFIGURATION
      ----------------------------------------------------------

    This FAILCODE can occur when any of the extracted files is missing
    or renamed.  Some of the files can be modified, but they must not be
    removed or renamed. This strict requirement is a protection for the
    integrity and support of VCrayApp use in raylib-based VC/C++ projects.

TODO

 * Create a screen capture of a FAILCODE1 from the VCrayApp.bat 0.1.0
   release candidate.

 * Adapt the FAIL0 index.md for FAIL1 with the image and explanation.

 * There needs to be a manifest to check against.  It might need to be
   elsewhere.  It will be release-specific.  Hmm, not liking this.

 * Place a link in the message from the VCrayApp.bat for 0.1.0 (beta)
