![FAILCODE6](FAIL6-2023-04-21-1534-VCrayApp-0.1.0.png)

FAILCODE6 signifies that a released **source-code** version of raylib, in a
folder named `raylib\` is not positioned properly on the same drive and level
as the unzipped VCrayApp project.

The determination is that `raylib\src\raylib.h` does not exist using the
location described in the diagnostic message.

NOTE: If a clone of the raylib Github repository is used, the folder holding
the clone must be named `raylib` no matter what the clone is named.

See [VCrayApp Setup](../../D211101a) for more details.
