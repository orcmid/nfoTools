            VCRAYAPP FAILCODE7: RAYLIB VERSION NOT > 3.0.0
            ----------------------------------------------

    This FAILCODE occurs when a pre-3.0.0 version of raylib\ appears to be
    installed.  This is determined when raylib.h does not provide a version
    setting, as is done for 4.x.0, and other characteristic files are or
    are not present, differently than for supported 3.x.0 releases.

    It should not happen with a raylib\src\raylib.h produced since 4.0.0.

    The first case is the most likely and the text should should point to
    that.

    FAILCODE7 is provoked by installing an old raylib release to demonstrate
    this case.
