        VCRAYAPP FAILCODE5: PRODUCING/OPERATING %VCEXE% FAILED
        ------------------------------------------------------

    This FAILCODE is most likely to be encountered when building from the
    project source.  Some of the cases are unlikely and will indicate that
    there is some sort of damage or discrepancy in operation.

    The last case is most likely and its trouble-shooting is comparable for
    all of the possible reasons.

TODOS:

 * Create index.md reflecting both terse and verbose (faked) cases.

 * Explain that there should be more details just above the FAIL5 message,
   and that running verbose is usually more helpful.

 * Describe the different possible names in the FAIL5 message.
