       VCRAYAPP FAILCODE2: UNSUPPORTED VCRAYAPP.BAT PARAMETERS
       -------------------------------------------------------

    This FAILCODE occurs when the command line for operation of VCrayApp.bat
    has unrecognized parameters.  They can appear anywhere in the command
    text.  The FAILCODE is followed by the parameters starting with the
    unsupported one.

    This will usually be a simple error corrected by retrying VCrayApp with
    the corrected parameters.

    When this occurs in an embedded use of VCrayApp, remedy may be more
    involved.
