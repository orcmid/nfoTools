| This Version | as of VCrayApp 0.1.0 beta release | [D211101e](../D211101e) |

This is beta release material.  It is preserved in all developments of
VCrayApp materials.  Whenever a FAIL message is new or substantially changed,
an existing `FAILCODE` will not be reused.

These explanations are intended to support trouble-shooting and failures in
performance of `VCrayApp.bat` in a VCrayApp-based project.  Feedback on actual
experience and the utility of these explanations is extremely valuable.

Feedback and requests concerning this beta material should be addressed to
the [nfoTools GitHub Project](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools) with mention
of D211101 and the particular `FAILCODE`.

Review [discussions](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/discussions),
[issues](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/issues), and
[projects](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/projects?type=classic) for
discussions and comments related to specific VCrayApp releases.  All questions
and comments are appreciated.
