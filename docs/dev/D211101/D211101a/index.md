## TOMBSTONE

This page is referenced in VCrayApp-0.0.0 material.  It is no longer the
location for "VCrayApp Setup" information.

The current material is at [D211101a: VCrayApp Setup](../a).  It may also
be important to switch to VCrayApp-0.1.0 or later because of the breaking
changes that have been made since VCrayApp-0.0.0 (alpha).
