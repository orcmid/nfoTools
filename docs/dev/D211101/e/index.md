This is a beta release.  It is provided at this point in VCrayApp development
to obtain confirmation and feedback prior to declaration of a 1.0.0 stable
release for broad usage.  There is complete functionality.  The stable
release is expected to consist of touch-ups for clarity and repair of defects.

To determine whether VCrayApp 0.1.0 is useful without difficulty for you,
please read the file [VCrayApp-0.1.0.txt](VCrayApp-0.1.0.txt).  Also consult
the current main page [VCrayApp: VC/C++ Command-Line raylib App DevKit](..),
information on [VCrayApp Setup](../a), and information on
[VCrayApp Operation](../b).  These materials are in draft form for
review and improvement as part of VCrayApp-1.0.0 stable-release preparation.

If VCrayApp 0.0.0 (alpha) has been used, please consult
[CHANGES-0.1.0.txt](CHANGES-0.1.0.txt) for information regarding changes that
will be in effect upon installing VCrayApp-0.1.0 in place of VCrayApp-0.0.0.
It is important to understand the breaking changes and some differences in
operation.  It may be more convenient to install VCrayApp-0.1.0 in a new
folder at the same level as the existing project, moving your VCrayApp-0.0.0
src\ content and any app\ resources to the new VCrayApp project.  (To use the
same VCrayApp-project folder name, rename the existing folder to a variation,
making the desired name reusable for the VCrayApp-0.1.0 extraction.)
