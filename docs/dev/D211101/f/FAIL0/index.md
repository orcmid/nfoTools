![FAILCODE0 Message](FAIL0-2023-05-11-1112-VCrayApp-0.1.0.png)

This message should never be encountered.  It occurs if the version of
`CMD.exe` being used does not support `CMD EXTENSIONS`.  This should not be
possible with any properly-configured version of Microsoft Windows on an
x64 desktop PC.

One possibility is operation on an inappropriate virtual computer.

Another possibility is damage in installation of VCrayApp or modifications
to the `VCrayApp.bat` file.

Finally, `CMD EXTENSIONS` may have been disabled by some means.  Unless that
can be changed, VCrayApp is not usable.

If a case of this has been encountered "in the wild," please report in an
[nfoTools Discussion](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/discussions)
mentioning VCrayApp FAILCODE0.
