          VCRAYAPP FAILCODE6: RAYLIB NOT FOUND WHERE EXPECTED
          ---------------------------------------------------

    This FAILCODE is most likely during initial setup and operation.

    It might happen if there is some alteration of VCrayApp.bat to change
    the raylib\ location.

    The first case is the most likely and the text should should point to
    that.

    FAILCODE6 is provoked by renaming the VCrayApp\raylib\ temporarily and
    gaining a screen capture.
