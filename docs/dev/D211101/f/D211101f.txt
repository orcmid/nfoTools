            D211101f: VCRAYAPP FAILURE-MESSAGE EXPLANATIONS
            -----------------------------------------------

   VCrayApp.bat produces a variety of identified FAILCODEs.  This folder
   provides individual explanations and guidance that are reached by links
   in VCrayApp.bat messages.

   The folders of FAILCODE explanations do not follow the folio accession-
   numbering system.  It is more important that simple links are provided
   in the references from VCrayApp.bat messages.

TODO

 * There needs to be non-failure advisory-message explanations also.  Those
   might be under the individual D211101a-c pages.

 * Do not over-explain when there are generic matters, such as how to handle
   compiler error and warning messages, what the parameters of builds are
   about, and so on.  Generic/comprehensive materials may belong in other
   places.  So there will be TODOs at other locations on required support of
   a more-general nature.

 * Point out that the screen captures are verbose (or not) versions.
   o Check FAIL1 and correct for this as needed

 * Should we show both flavors terse/verbose when they differ?  Sometimes.

 * Projects should link to the Classic Projects being used.
   <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/projects?type=classic>.
   Propogate this to all other docs/ pages.

 * The screen captures may be confusing for novices because they are done
   from within VCrayApp\dev\ for development.  When I've covered all the
   cases, retake all of the screen shots.

 * The scheme will become complicated if there are any diagnostic message
   changes at all.  Need a way to finess that.  Or stabilize on 1.0.0 and
   then worry only if there need to be changes later.

 * The statement about FAILCODEs not being reused needs to be clearer.

 * Explain the categories of error messages.  There is only one message
   pertaining to the project code itself.  All of the rest are related to
   verification of the configuration of the VCrayApp project, to the
   successful compilation of a simple C Language program to check the
   raylib version, and then compiling of the cache and a confirmation program
   relying on that cache.
