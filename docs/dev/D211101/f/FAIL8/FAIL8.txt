          VCRAYAPP FAILCODE8: RAYLIB %VCRAYVER% NOT SUPPORTED
          ---------------------------------------------------

    This FAILCODE occurs when a post-4.0.0 version of raylib\ is used and
    for which the specific raylib release has defects that prevent it being
    usable with VC/C++.

    This happens in the case of raylib 4.2.0 for which the VCrayApp cache
    cannot be compiled.
