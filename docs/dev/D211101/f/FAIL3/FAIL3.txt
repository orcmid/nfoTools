       VCRAYAPP FAILCODE3: NO VS NATIVE COMMAND-LINE ENVIRONMENT
       ---------------------------------------------------------

    This FAILCODE occurs when a Command Prompt session has not been started
    using a Native Visual Studio Command Prompt and CMD default command shell.

    When one of the Visual Studio (Build Tools) is used to commence command-
    line terminals, an environment for automatic use of tools and libraries
    is established.  The recommended "x64 Native Tools Command Prompt ..."
    (and the others) will set an environment variable that identifies the
    Visual Studio version involved.

    The explanation is under D211101d on VCrayApp Operation.
