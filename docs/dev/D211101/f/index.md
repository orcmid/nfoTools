This material is provided to supplement VCrayApp **FAILCODE***n* messages from
`VCrayApp.bat` starting with VCrayApp-0.1.0. FAILCODEs are not reused.

These explanations are intended to support trouble-shooting and failures in
performance of `VCrayApp.bat` in a VCrayApp-based project.

Feedback and requests concerning this material should be addressed to
the [nfoTools GitHub Project](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools) with mention
of D211101 and the particular `FAILCODE`.  Feedback on actual
experience and the utility of these explanations is valuable.

Review [discussions](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/discussions),
[issues](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/issues), and
[projects](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/projects?type=classic) for
discussions and comments related to specific VCrayApp releases and their
application.
