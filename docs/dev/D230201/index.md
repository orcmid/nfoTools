## 1. Overview

**PLACEHOLDER AS A TARGET FOR URLS.  CONTENT TO FOLLOW.**

## 2. Prerequisites and Dependencies

**NOTE:** Current materials are now at the *pre-alpha* level,

Using pre-built VCShowDef customizations is straightforward.  Development
of new customizations requires some understanding of essential tools along with confident use of C Language:

* Windows File Explorer
* [Visual Studio Native Build Tools](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T211002/)
* [Developer Command Prompt](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T060501/)
* VC/C++ Command Line Compiler, `CL.exe`

VCshowDefs is designed to work with versions of Visual Studio that are free
for personal use, including the Visual Studio Build Tools (recommended)
and the Visual Studio Community editions.  Additional levels of Visual
Studio can also be used, all via their Native Tools Command Prompt.

### Disclaimer

VCshowDefs tends to be compiler and platform specific.  The technique may be
adaptable to other tools, such as GCC used on Windows, Linux, and other
platforms.  Portability is not assured.

The template and the confirmation case may be valuable in confirming operation
with other compilers.  Those use cases are out of scope for nfoTools at this
time.  Consult other sources for variations on VCshowDefs.
