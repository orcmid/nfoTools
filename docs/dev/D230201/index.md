## 1. Overview

## 2. Prerequisites and Dependencies

**NOTE:** Current materials are now at the *alpha* level,

***EDITOR NOTES: SOFTEN THIS STATEMENT AND MAKE IT STRAIGHTFORWARD***

***SUCCESSFUL USE OF VCrayAPP REQUIRES CONFIDENT USE OF C LANGUAGE AND A
C/C++ LANGUAGE COMPILER*** for creation of clean programs involving source
files, include files, and the interfaces (APIs) of standard libraries as well
as the special-purpose raylib libraries.  For more on C Language see
[T060101: C/C++ Programming](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T060101/).

It is assumed that Microsoft Windows 7 Professional or later are used.
Thorough VCrayApp testing is with Microsoft Windows 10 latest versions.

Development with VCrayApp and illustration of usage involves the following
tools along with confident use of C Language:

* Windows File Explorer
* [Visual Studio Native Build Tools](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T211002/)
* [Developer Command Prompt](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T060501/)
* VC/C++ Command Line Compiler, `CL.exe`

VCshowDefs is designed to work with versions of Visual Studio that are free
for personal use, including the Visual Studio Build Tools (recommended)
and the Visual Studio Community editions.  Additional levels of Visual
Studio can also be used, all via their Native Tools Command Prompt.

### Disclaimer

VCshowDefs tends to be compiler and platform specific.  The technique may be
adaptable to other tools, such as GCC used on Windows, Linux, and other
platforms.

The template and the confirmation case may be valuable in confirming operation
with other compilers.  Those use cases are out of scope for nfoTools at this
time.  Consult other sources for variations on VCshowDefs.
