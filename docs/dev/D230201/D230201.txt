            VCshowDefs: SHOW PREPROCESSOR DEFINES IN VC/C++
            ===============================================

    A family of small C/C++ Language programs that demonstrate the values
    of preprocessor settings introduced-by/used-in various libraries,
    including the C Language Standard libraries and other libraries of
    interest.  These are useful for confirmation of settings and also for
    identifying what platform-specific settings might be in a particular
    compilation configuration.
