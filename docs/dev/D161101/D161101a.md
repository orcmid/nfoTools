## Diary and Job Jar from nfoWare d161101a unresolved items as of 2021-09-11

| ***Status YYYY/MM/DD*** | ***YYYY/MM/DD*** | ***Description*** |
|      :-:     |   :-:      |       ---         |
| | 2017-02-23 | d161101: Emphasize the use as a component and less the free-standing use, although that is still supported. |
| | 2017-02-22 | d161101: Provide attribution |
| | 2017-02-22 | d161101: Provide links to all of the specialized mentions in the Synopsis and the 5Ps.  These could be via the "Available Materials" |
| | 2016-11-23 | Provide links, when available, on toolcraft for verifying sha256 digests and openPGP signatures \[dh:2016-11-25 This can now be done at the default page of d161101c-dist\] |
| | 2016-11-22 | Emphasize requiring only freely-available tools in VCbind.txt here as well as overall concerning Toolcraft. |
| | 2016-11-22 | Add further detail about how Toolcraft, TROST, and the ability for anyone to confirm functioning of VCbind,  with prerequisite preparation.|
| | 2016-11-22 | The Visual Studio 2017 Release candidates do not set a common toolset environment variable.  Figure out how to work without that when the full release occurs.  This is the occasion for 0.2.0 and having the sample build.  \[dh:2017-02-22 This is going to be later.  0.2.0 should be short of VS 2017 and also need not have all the confirmation arrangements.\]\[dh:2017-12-26 I now know how to locate VS2017 vcvars code.  It is a tricky case because there is no environment setting to use but a fixed location provides shortcuts that can be used.\] |
| | 2016-11-22 | Link to reference on creating and using batch scripts somewhere.  There is now (Windows 10) extensive help files built in, along with more on MSDN.  There is also the Command Line Administrator's Pocket Handbook. \[dh:2016-11-25 I think I started that somewhere.  Find it.\] |
| | 2016-11-22 | Verify the VCbind structure with VS2005 (080) and all subsequent VS Express and Community installs. \[dh:2016-11-25 That is a good way to work the checklist.\]\[dh:2017-12-26 Freeze 0.2.0 without VS2017, then work on getting VS 2017 working for 0.3.0.\] |
| | 2016-11-22 | Provide a checklist of the testing cases that apply to VCbind.bat.  The full testing is needed for a release candidate and also the level of testing needs to be accounted for in a pull request. |
| | 2016-11-22 | Find out what config cases never work on older toolset versions, and rule them out at the VCbind.bat level. |
| | 2016-11-22 | The term for cmd.exe is "command shell."  Use consistently.  See [Microsoft Technet](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490954.aspx). |
| | 2016-11-22 | Provide/Point to "help cmd" and also point out that extensive help on the command shell is avalable off-line |
| | 2016-11-22 | Beyond 0.1.0, confirm VCbind.bat, Powershell, MSYS2,  CygWin and other Unix-style shells.  TC also.  \[dh:2016-12-03 The hack for unwinding case-sensitive use of the Environment will be difficult to address.\] |
| | 2016-11-22 | Include a tip about making handy shortcuts for testing, either as part of toolcraft or here.  There needs to be guidance or a hint about that in VCbind.txt? |
| | 2016-11-22 | Testing and confirmation of VCbind.zip should be included in VCbind.zip, along with smoketest procedures and sample compilation.  The first smoketest is to simply run `cl.exe` with no parameters.  The second is to compile and then run a sample. |
