                VCBIND: VC/C++ COMMAND-LINE SETUP SCRIPT
                -----------------------------------------

VCbind consists of a Zip package that can be included in a software
construction set to simplify command-line compiling of C/C++ language programs
using Microsoft Windows developer tools.  VCbind is easily deployed
within GitHub carried projects.
  
Approach

* Operation with freely-available and free-to-use development tools.
* Simple manual instructions for free-standing use and for incorporation
  in construction sets designed for novice usage.
* Sufficient for incorporation inside more-elaborate construction sets.

Plan

* Develop VCbind on GitHub as part of the nfoTools project.
* Provide pilot demonstration in selected projects
* Roll-up stable-enough versions to VCbinder packagings
* Confirm in prototype WinCon Construction Sets
* Roll up VCbind and VCbinder into a WinCon Construction Kit that is reliable
  as a source for additional construction sets and their updates.
* Include confirmation materials and approaches.
* Provide exemplary applications.
* Deal with levels of prerequisite and progressive disclosure

TODO

 * Introduce Banner and Footer as appropriate

 * Get ClustrMap working for nfoTools?

 * Migrate materials here so that downloads can be obtained from here and
   information about and in them point to nfoTools instead of nfoware.com.

 * This will come with clean-up of devKits in the orcmid/nfoTools repositiory.

 * Bring VCbind d161101 here so that a new VCbind update with only
   documentation changes will reference D161101 here.  This is the poster-
   -child for how to do the progression of versions.

 * Dig into the d161101a Job Jar for more

 * Bring over *all* additional pages beyond the folio cover

 * Get them over here raw, then smooth things out

 * Bring VCbind 0.1.0 here with a single subfolder for the release artifacts,
   including the signed materials.  There is simply the distro and how to use
   it.  This is going to be deprecated because the material is hashed and
   signed and it refers to locations on nfoWare.com that will be retired.

 * Verify the hashes and signatures

 * Creste skills and toolcraft on handling hashes and signatures

 * Make more careful separation between using VCbind.zip when found in a
   source distribution that one intends to construct versus incorporating
   VCbind.zip in the source of a release of ones own.
