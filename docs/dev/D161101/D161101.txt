TODO

 * Introduce Banner and Footer as appropriate

 * Get ClustrMap working for nfoTools?

 * Migrate materials here so that downloads can be obtained from here and
   information about and in them point to nfoTools instead of nfoware.com.

 * This will come with clean-up of devKits in the orcmid/nfoTools repositiory.

 * Bring VCbind d161101 here so that a new VCbind that update without changes
   can reference D161101 here.  It is the poster-child for how to do the
   progression of versions.

 * Dig into the d151101a Job Jar for more

 * Bring over additional pages beyond the folio cover
