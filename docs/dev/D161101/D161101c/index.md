# ***VCbind** 0.1.0 Release (Preservation)*

***VCbind*** consists of a Zip package that can be included in a software
construction set to simplify command-line compiling of C/C++ language programs
using Microsoft Windows developer tools.  ***VCbind*** is easily deployed
within GitHub carried projects.

## Intended Usage

When code containing **`VCbind.zip`** is found in a software construction set,
extract the contents of the Zip package into a folder.  Rely on the script
and other materials in the folder to establish the command-line environment
for use of Microsoft Build Tools.  The extracted **`VCbind.bat`** file sets up
the command-line environment for use of the Microsoft command-line compiler,
 **`cl.exe`**, and other development tools.

When construction sets have their own procedures for their overall operation,
those instructions are relied upon for how and when ***VCbind*** is used.

## Purpose

Provide a redistributable script that automatically locates and sets up a
command-line environment for operations of the installed Windows C/C++
development tools.
  
## Principles

* Only tools already available as part of Microsoft Windows Desktop PCs are
needed, along with the simplest addition of freely-available development
tools.
* Simple use of Microsoft "batch commands" is all that's required, with any
parameters entirely optional.
* For the few prerequisites, links to tutorials and examples are plentiful.
* Error messages guide users in providing remedies and in finding additional
trouble-shooting details.
* The software is "code in the open" that can be customized for local use and
adapted for additional construction sets, language localizations, and other
custom purposes.
