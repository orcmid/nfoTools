## 1. Synopsis

VCrayMathStudio is a suite of examples, tutorial explanations, and a variety
of demonstration programs for celebrating the carefully-crafted
[ raymath.h](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib/blob/master/src/raylib.h)
portion of [Ramon Santamaria's raylib library](https://www.raylib.com/) for
constructing graphical software.

The objective is to be instructive and to illuminate the careful crafting of
`raymath.h` and the ways to make use of it as part of impressive computer
graphics applications.

VCrayMathStudio uses [VCrayApp](../D211101/) for compilation and demonstration
of exploratory programs; some operated from the
[ command line](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T060501/) and others
performed as raylib graphical applications.  The Microsoft VC/C++ compiler and
[Visual Studio Build Tools](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T211002/)
are used throughout.  The assumed platform is an x64 Windows desktop PC.
These specific selections provide for consistent, clear-cut results.

Using these studies for explorations of variations on other platforms is
invited.  Accounting for platform and compiling variations is out of scope
for VCrayMathStudio.

## 2. Prerequisites and Dependencies

**NOTE:** Current materials are now at the *alpha* level.  There is incomplete
material.  This will change with progressive improvements until a
*beta* level is feasible. The *beta* level will have expanded coverage
suitable for novice developers and those who are curious about how mathematics
and numerical analysis are important in computer graphics.

Although the narratives and examples are intended to be informative on their
own, inspection of the illustrative programs and duplicating them for
individual purposes will require successful use of [VCrayApp](../D211101/).

## 4. Development

Development within the GitHub
[orcmid/nfoTools](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools) project is at the
[devKits/WinDev/VCrayMathStudio](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/tree/master/devKits/WinDev/VCrayMathStudio)
on the main branch.

### 4.1 Principles

* Operation with freely-available and free-to-use development tools.
* Safe for novice developers and others keen to explore the numerical and
 mathematical techniques applicable in the programming of computer graphics
* Simple standalone creation and use of illustrative materials demonstrated
in mini-projects worked out using native Windows programs.
* Fostering understanding and application of raymath functions in creation of
raylib-based computer graphics.

 ### 4.2 Plan

* Use a spiraling development for gathering together related functions and
covering them, lower-level functions first.  Populate progressively.
* Construct a topic-based catalog of the raymath functions, organized around
the grouping of capabilities and their application in numerical work
supporting computer graphics.
* Construct an alphabetical index of the functions and where there are
applied as demonstrations and explanations are introduced.
* Update continuously, building out the coverage and responding to feedback.
