             VCraymathStudio raymath Exploration Devkit
             ------------------------------------------

VCrayMathStudio is a suite of examples, tutorial explanations, and a variety
of demonstration programs for celebrating the carefully-crafted raymath.h
portion of the raylib source code.

VCrayMath uses VCrayApp for compilation and demonstration of exploratory
programs, some operating from the command line and others as raylib graphical
applications.

The objective is to be instructive and to illuminate the careful crafting of
raylib.h and the ways to make use of it as part of impressive computer
graphics applications.

TODO

 * As raymath.h is reviewed, create a classification and progression of the
   functions to understand the underlying mathematical and computational
   structures, then going from linear algebra to the geometric/2D-3D cases.
   If this becomes two great of a span, consider breaking into more docs/dev
   topics.

 * Create a short sketch for index.md, providing the 5 Ps in the manner of
   D211101/index.md.

 * Introduce the motivation of teaching to learn.

 * Don't connect to dev/ until there is enough worth watching.

 * The first spread should be the outline of topics to be covered.

 * We need to tie everything in this docs/dev/D230501/ to wherever we work
   on the code elements in devKits\WinDev\VCrayMathStudio\.  There needs to
   be an useful correspondence.

 * D230501a should be a catalog of functions by topics.  There might also
   need to be an alphabetic index of the functions and maybe how they are
   emphasized within particular illustrations.

  * (From docs.txt) There need to be dev/, skills/, and tools/ around
    Numerical Analysis and all the techniques for high-performance computing,
    graphical computations, etc.  The contributions and historical position of
    Turing Award recipients needs to be acknowledge around here also.  This
    project for VCrayMathStudio can serve some of this.

  * The 1954-05-07 announcement of the IBM 704 is striking, as the first
    computer to incorporate indexing and floating-point arithmetic.  Both
    FORTRAN and LISP were first developed on the 704 according to an
    anniversary announcement on the Official ACM Twitter.
    <https://twitter.com/TheOfficialACM/status/1655197317576773635>.  The
    photo is also fascinating.

  * I am thinking about some preliminaries around integer arithmetic, the
    problem with radix (i.e., decimal and binary) fraction notation, and then
    the range versus precision problem with floating point.

  * Need to look at Knuth vol.2 on Seminumerical algorithms and what that
    choice signifies.

  * Also remark on the nomenclature problem: integer and real as mathematical
    versus int, float, double, long things, unsigned things, as about
    arithmetics.  Likewise char.
