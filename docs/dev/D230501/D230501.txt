VCrayApp consists of a Zip package for a software construction set to simplify
command-line compiling of C/C++ language programs using Microsoft Windows
developer tools and the raysan5/raylib library for graphical applications.
VCrayApp is delivered in a form that can be confirmed for correct
operation before customization as part of a specific project.

TODO

 * As raymath.h is reviewed, create a classification and progression of the
   functions to understand the underlying mathematical and computational
   structures, then going from linear algebra to the geometric/2D-3D cases.
   If this becomes two great of a span, consider breaking into more docs/dev
   topics.

 * Create a short sketch for index.md, providing the 5 Ps in the manner of
   D211101/index.md.

 * Introduce the motivation of teaching to learn.

 * Don't connect to dev/ until there is enough worth watching.

 * The first spread should be the outline of topics to be covered.

 * We need to tie everything in this docs/dev/D230501/ to wherever we work
   on the code elements in devKits\WinDev\VCrayMathStudio\.  There needs to
   be an useful correspondence.
