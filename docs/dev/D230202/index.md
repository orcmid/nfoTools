## 1. Overview

**PLACEHOLDER AS A TARGET FOR URLS.  CONTENT TO FOLLOW.**

## 2. Prerequisites and Dependencies

**NOTE:** Current materials are now at an *iterative drafts* level, pending
achievement of a beta release.

Usage of VCrayVerify requires confident use of

* Windows File Explorer
* [Visual Studio Native Build Tools](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T211002/)
* [Developer Command Prompt](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T060501/)
* VC/C++ Command Line Compiler, `CL.exe`

VCrayVerify employs an embedded setup of [VCrayApp](..\D211101).
It may be necessary to work with that VCrayApp trouble-shooting a VCrayVerify
error condition.  See the [Available Materials](#3-available-materials) for
further details.

VCrayVerify is designed to work with versions of Visual Studio that are free
for personal use, including the Visual Studio Build Tools (recommended)
and the Visual Studio Community editions.  Additional levels of Visual
Studio can also be used, all via their Native Tools Command Prompt.

### Disclaimer

VCrayVerify is compiler and platform specific.  Support is limited to
the VC/C++ compiler and Visual Studio Build Tools releases. Portabillity is
not assured.  The technique may be adaptable to other tools, such as GCC used
on Windows, Linux, and other platforms.  Interoperability is not an objective.
