       VCrayVerify TEST HARNESS FOR VERIFYING RAYLIB EXAMPLES
       ======================================================

    VCrayVerify is a test suite for verification of the examples that are
    included in a raylib release distribution.  It can also be used with a
    dev branch to see if examples continue to build and operate properly.

    This is also demonstration that VCrayApp is working properly with the
    particular examples and raylib release or current "-dev" version source
    code.  VCrayVerify incorporates a customization of the latest VCrayApp
    for compilation and operation of the raylib examples.

    VCrayVerify can also pin-point situations where the Visual Studio Build
    Tools do not support features of C Language standards that an example or
    the required raylib modules depend on.

    To facilitate the focused reuse of VCrayVerify as part of example
    verification, the VCrayVerify command parameters provide for focusing
    on a particular category of examples and even individual examples.

TODO

 * Document the key technique and the typical use cases, then catalog the
   prebuilt ones that are useful for checking use of various configurations.

 * Provide folio for distributions of VCrayVerify releases, documenting their
   usage.

 * Use the standard folio structure, D230202a Setup, D230202b Operation,
   D230202c Testing/Improvement, and D230302d VCrayVerify 0.0.0 (beta), etc.

 * Fix typo in D230202d Available Materials entry.
