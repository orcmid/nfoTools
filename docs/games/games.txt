                          ----------------------

    nfoTools docs/games/ is a collection of material on games.  Not so much
    gamedev, but using games, finding games, finding gamers, and so on. Actual
    game development surfaces under docs/dev/ and, for significant games,
    under their own projects.

    The pattern of chronological cataloguing is on the same pattern as other
    documentation sections, using G-prefixed folios/pages.

TODO

 * Migrate items on games here, although this is about finding and playing
   them, generally not constructing them (unless that's the game).

 * What about other recreational computing?  Then it is like fun or fun &
   games.  Think it over.

 * Inventory existing games material for potential treatment here.

 * Need to distinguish games and gaming and gamedev?

 * Scrounge my OneNote collection on gaming and adventuring

 * Tie into Azure Gaming including the Cognitive Services Reference
   Architecture,
   <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/gaming/azure/reference-architectures/cognitive>

 * Also the 5 key properties of a good game.  These will all influence the
   progression of Adv10.

 * So I am definitely crossed up about this being for games and also gamedev?
   Follow my own advice and move gaming items to nfoTools/docs/dev.

 * For beginners through advanced, gamedev.tv is a great resource.  Feature
   these two:
   <https://www.gamedev.tv/courses/extra/lectures/20006195>
   and <https://www.gamedev.tv/courses/extra/lectures/12335656>.
   The second, on learning an engine is appropriate to learning C/C++ and
   learning how to work builds before, if interested, having Visual Studio
   do that for you.
