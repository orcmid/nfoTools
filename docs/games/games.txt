    nfoTools docs/games/ is a collection of material on games.  Not so much
    gamedev, but using games, finding games, finding gamers, and so on. Actua
    game development surfaces under docs/dev/ and, for significant games,
    under their own projects.  The pattern of chronological cataloguing is on
    the same pattern as other documentation sections, using G-prefixed
    folios/pages.

TODO

 * Create a place-holder page.

 * Migrate items on games here, although this is about finding and playing
   them, generally not constructing them (unless that's the game).

 * I want an icon for Games that is distinct on folios on games.  The chess
   king image would be great.

 * What about other recreational computing?  Then it is like fun or fun &
   games.  Think it over.

 * Do we need nfoWare/gaming, and what about recreational computing?  I guess
   the chess king image would go well here though.

 * Inventory existing games material for potential treatment here.
