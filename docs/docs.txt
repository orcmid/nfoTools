             NFOTOOLS DOCUMENTATION-AUTHORING CONSTRUCTION STRUCTURE
             -------------------------------------------------------

    Documentation of nfoTools, their use and customization, is created and
    maintained at <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/blob/master/docs/>.
    This authored material is automatically published to the web site at
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/> after conversion of authored .md
    files to .html files.  This is a GitHub project configuration feature.

    This file, doc.txt, is the entry to the site-authoring construction
    structure.  That structure is also conveyed into the web site where it
    is mirrored in the site itself.  The pattern for such site construction
    is described under the Document Engineering Project (docEng), at
    <https://github.com/orcmid/docEng> (https://orcmid.github.io/docEng/)

   Hamilton, Dennis E. nfoTools Documentation-Authoring Construction
   Structure.  nfoTools project text file nfoTools.txt version 0.0.11 dated
   2021-09-22, available on the Internet as a version of

TODO

  * Explain how this folder is used to generate the GitHub pages, possibly
    with additional folders that are about the scaffolding and construction
    materials.  This should be under construction materials.  It shouuld be
    thin enough to be linked to docEng rather than duplicate what should be
    there for general application.

  * Figure out what to do about Jekyll and its templates.

  * Find another way (other than Jekyll) if there can be one.  MathJax is not
    crucial here, but other theming is desirable.  Again, this is also a
    docEng consideration.  And Miser could definitely benefit from MathJax.

  * Provide detailed connection to the docEng pattern documentation whenever.

  * Migrate all dependencies on nfoWare.com content to dependencies here that
    make sense.  This might need to tie into release cases, although we are
    talking about finer-grained releases than any kind of nfoTools "release."
    There needs to be a software engineering patterm for this too?  The use of
    branches is being considered for this.

  * Add the usual arrangement by cribbing from nfoWare.com's construction-
    structure approach.

  * Tuck away and re-use the "this page intentionally blank" image.

  * Add LICENSE and NOTICES, also place copyright symbol, etc. Add an
    explanation sort of like the Creative Commons simple deed.  Maybe in
    NOTICES.

  * Arrange link to the (this) construction structure.

  * Be prepared to take up the slack when nfoWare and nfoWorks are retired
    as web sites.

  * Attribution on the published pages too?

  * Deal with prerequisites.  See the statement at rayLab on the subject.
    Here, we want to provide more and also find something gentle enough
    for beginners.  This is what skills is intended to butress.  Need to
    get going on those and on the toolcraft too.

  * Find out if the GitHub desktop works all right without Git for Windows.
    Also VS Code.  We need to look at the VS Code, then Git for Windows, then
    Tortoise Git.  How close to the front can we put GitHub Desktop?  It
    would be gret to avoid the whole Git for Windows forced-preferences
    cluster.

  * Figure out the difference/connection between versions of these pages as
    rendered and the sources from which those are published.  This is
    different from when the source was version-controlled HTML.

  * Some of these topics are on construction and scaffolding and now belong
    under construction/
