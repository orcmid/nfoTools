             NFOTOOLS DOCUMENTATION-AUTHORING CONSTRUCTION STRUCTURE
             -------------------------------------------------------

    Documentation of nfoTools, their use and customization, is created and
    maintained at <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/blob/master/docs/>.
    This authored material is automatically published to the web site at
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/> after conversion of authored .md
    files to .html files.  This is a GitHub project configuration feature.

    This file, doc.txt, is the entry to the site-authoring construction
    structure.  That structure is also conveyed into the web site where it
    is mirrored in the site itself.  The pattern for such site construction
    is described under the Document Engineering Project (docEng), at
    <https://github.com/orcmid/docEng> (https://orcmid.github.io/docEng/)

    skills/
        folios on skills that are tacit for software development and not
        taught here, but recognized and perhaps motivated, along with the
        limitations of the US-centric approach that is my tacit burden

    tools/
        folios on acquiring and maybe using tools employed in nfoTools
        setups suitable for following by beginners.

   Structure.  nfoTools project text file nfoTools.txt version 0.0.6 dated

TODO

  * Explain how this folder is used to generate the GitHub pages, possibly
    with additional folders that are about the scaffolding and construction
    materials.

  * Figure out what to do about Jekyll and its templates.

  * Find another way if there can be one.  MathJax is not crucial here, but
    other theming is desirable.

  * Provide detailed connection to the docEng pattern documentation whenever.

  * Migrate all dependencies on nfoWare.com content to dependencies here that
    make sense.  This might need to tie into release cases, although we are
    talking about finer-grained releases than any kind of nfoTools "release."
    There needs to be an engineering patterm for this too?  The use of
    branches is being considered for this.

  * Add the usual arrangement by cribbing from nfoWare.com's construction-
    structure approach.

  * Tuck away and re-use the "this page intentionally blank" image.

  * Add LICENSE and NOTICES, also place copyright symbol, etc. Add an
    explanation sort of like the Creative Commons simple deed.  Maybe in
    NOTICES.

  * Arrange link to the (this) construction structure.

  * Find nfoTools structure to mimic in the organization here.

  * Be prepared to take up the slack when nfoWare and nfoWorks are retired
    as web sites.

  * Add attribution - on the published pages too?

  * Deal with prerequisites.  See the statement at rayLab on the subject.
    Here, we want to provide more and also find something gentle enough
    for beginners.

  * Find out if the GitHub desktop works all right without Git for Windows.
    Also VS Code.  We need to look at the VS Code, then Git for Windows, then
    Tortoise Git.  How close to the front can we put GitHub Desktop?

  * Figure out the difference/connection between versions of these pages as
    rendered and the sources from which those are published.  This is
    different from when the source was version-controlled HTML.
