             NFOTOOLS DOCUMENTATION-AUTHORING CONSTRUCTION STRUCTURE
             -------------------------------------------------------

    Documentation of nfoTools, their use and customization, is created and
    maintained at <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/blob/master/docs/>.
    This authored material is automatically published to the web site at
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/> after conversion of authored .md
    files to .html files.  This is a GitHub project configuration feature.

    This file, doc.txt, is the entry to the site-authoring construction
    structure.  That structure is also conveyed into the web site where it
    is mirrored in the site itself.  The pattern for such site construction
    is described under the Document Engineering Project (docEng), at
    <https://github.com/orcmid/docEng> (https://orcmid.github.io/docEng/)

TODO

  * Explain how this folder is used to generate the GitHub pages, possibly
    with additional folders that are about the scaffolding and construction
    materials.

  * Figure out what to do about Jekyll and its templates.

  * Find another way if there can be one.  MathJax is not crucial here, but
    other theming is desirable.

  * Provide detailed connection to the docEng pattern documentation whenever.

  * Migrate all dependencies on nfoWare.com content to dependencies here that
    make sense.  This might need to tie into release cases, although we are
    talking about finer-grained releases than any kind of nfoTools "release."
    There needs to be an engineering patterm for this too?  The use of
    branches is being considered for this.

  * Add the usual arrangement by cribbing from nfoWare.com's construction-
    structure approach.

  * Adjust this for its construction-structure front-porch role.

  * Find the welder image

  * Tuck away and re-use the "this page intentionally blank" image.

  * Add LICENSE and NOTICES, also place copyright symbol, etc. Add an
    explanation.

  * Arrange link to the (this) construction structure.

  * Find nfoTools structure to mimic in the organization here.

  * Be prepared to take up the slack when nfoWare and nfoWorks are retired
    as web sites.
