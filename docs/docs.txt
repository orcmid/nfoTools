             NFOTOOLS DOCUMENTATION-AUTHORING CONSTRUCTION STRUCTURE
             -------------------------------------------------------

    Documentation of nfoTools, their use and customization, is created and
    maintained at <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/blob/master/docs/>.
    This authored material is automatically published to the web site at
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/> after conversion of authored .md
    files to .html files.  This is a GitHub project configuration feature.

    This file, doc.txt, is the entry to the site-authoring construction
    structure.  That structure is also conveyed into the web site where it
    is mirrored in the site itself.  The pattern for such site construction
    will be described under the Document Engineering Project (docEng), at
    <https://github.com/orcmid/docEng>.

   Structure.  nfoTools project text file docs.txt version 0.0.24 dated

TODO

  * Retro to nfoCentrale construction structure with the assistance of
    FrontPage.  Curate the salvaged material for integration with nfoTools
    on GitHub.

  * As part of curation, advance the separation of construction material
    from topical-content musings, discussion, and job jar.  This is improved
    Document Engineering accord for these situations.

  * Update construction to provide the Source Server scaffolding for the
    nfoTools docs.

  * Consider Hugo as an alternative authoring form. leading to many pages here
    being generated from a separate authoring folder. LaTex formulas are not
    crucial here, but other theming is desirable.  This is a docEng
    consideration.  Also, Visual Studio extensions applicable to Markup might
    figure i here also..

  * Hugo and KaTeX are going to be explored and once docEng has
    resolution for it, it may be used for construction here.  This may end
    up having authoring in a different folder and having generated HTML
    directed to docs/

  * Provide detailed connection to the docEng pattern documentation whenever.

  * Migrate all dependencies on nfoWare.com content to dependencies here that
    make sense.  This might need to tie into release cases, although we are
    talking about finer-grained releases than any kind of nfoTools "release."
    There needs to be a software engineering pattern for this too?  The use of
    branches is being considered for this.

  * Consider materials in nfoWorks.com that might apply here also, although
    maybe most of those belong to docEng?  Maybe nfoLocker is a case?  Also
    some tools that support crypto functions as well as others?

  * Add the usual arrangement by cribbing from nfoWare.com's construction-
    structure approach.

  * Tuck away and re-use the "this page intentionally blank" image in the
    DefaultPlacehoder here.

  * Add LICENSE and NOTICES, also place copyright symbol, etc. Add an
    explanation sort of like the Creative Commons simple deed.  Maybe in
    NOTICES.

  * Arrange link to the (this) construction structure.

  * Be prepared to take up the slack when nfoWare and nfoWorks are retired
    as web sites.

  * Attribution on the published pages too?

  * Deal with prerequisites.  See the statement at rayLab on the subject.
    Here, we want to provide more and also find something gentle enough
    for beginners.  This is what skills is intended to buttress.  Need to
    get going on those and on the toolcraft too.

  * Find out if the GitHub desktop works all right without Git for Windows.
    Also VS Code.  We need to look at the VS Code, then Git for Windows, then
    Tortoise Git.  How close to the front can we put GitHub Desktop?  It
    would be great to avoid the whole Git for Windows forced-preferences
    cluster.

  * There need to be dev/, skills/, and tools/ around Numerical Analysis and
    all the techniques for high-performance computing, graphical computations,
    and such.  The contributions and historical position of Turing Award
    recipients needs to be acknowledge around here also.  The project for
    VCrayMathStudio can serve some of this.

  * Add an audio topic for digital audio operation and such.  There might
    need to be one on graphics also, in this respect.  Consider music
    production and use of Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs).  Just like
    numerical analysis.  Also education topics with respect to this area.

  * Education and Learning are skills and might have some skills and devNotes.

  * We need something on the 3-y's: interoperability (i14y), accessibility
    (a11y), and internationalization (i18n).  Well, i18n is not a y but that's
    computation/software for you.

  * We need to look at tools/ for cryptographic purposes, notes/ perhaps on
    methodology, skills/ for cryptographic practices, and dev/ for actual
    implementations of cryptographic materials.

  * There is more about security, I suppose s*y, that needs to be handled.
    There is the whole Security Policy business and then there is also the
    handling of other cybersecurity aspects, risk management, writing secure
    code, etc.  So we have cybersecurity as a topic and also a need to have
    something about practices and TRUSTWORTHINESS.  trust/ might need to be
    a topic for all of this.

  * The retired nfoWorks.com has material (https://nfoworks.nfocenrale.com)
    related to security and also uses of XML namespaces around this topic.
    Some of this goes to docEng and docInterop.  But overall matters can be
    addressed here also.

  * Capture the retirement of SHA-1,
    <https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2022/12/nist-retires-sha-1-cryptographic-algorithm>
    in the above treatment.

  * See <https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/Hash-Functions> for specifics.

  * Accessibility applies to document engineering here, and also to toolcraft,
    including any tools/, notes/, and dev/ on the topic.  It applies to how
    nfoTools is accessible and how one creates accessible software.  This is
    not going to be easy.  I am shirking i18n with regard to docs/ itself,
    although Hugo seems to support that.  I don't think a11y can be ignored
    so emphatically.

  * This presentation on accessibility support with Microsoft tools is from
    2022-05-24
    <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/events/build-2022/od62-developer-tools-enable-everyone-to-be-productive-microsoft-ability-summit>

  * PUT THE URL CHANGES IN EFFECT WITH ALL NEW WORK.  RETROFIT AS QUICKLY AS
    POSSIBLE, ESPECIALLY WITH MATERIAL WE HOPE FOLKS WILL LINK INTO.  WE WILL
    NEED TOMBSTONES AND REDIRECTS FOR URLS THAT BECOME OBSOLETED.

  * Make this another FrontPage repository (perhaps using OrcmidsLair) and
    look at redirects from nfoWare/nfoWorks as materials are brought over.

  * This means bringing over templates, etc.  I need to think hard about this.
    I am rather fond of the dev/ folder here, so far.  I need to determine
    what is the most important for me and how it works best.
