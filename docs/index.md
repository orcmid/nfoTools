# Welcome to nfoTools

nfoTools is a collection of utilities and software components.  The
tools are designed for use in composition of larger software projects
for information-processing applications (and games of course).  nfoTools
can apply anywhere in the complete learning-and-improvement lifecycle of
software projects.

nfoTools includes a Toolcraft on-ramp that supports beginners who want
to understand more about programming and the tacit understanding that
experienced software developers have achieved.  Crawl first, then walk,
then run.

Progressive discloser is used in a way that allows more-experienced
visitors to quickly skip over details they already know.  Review of the
basics is always at hand as needed.

Emphasis is on development of software for Microsoft Windows and using
Microsoft Windows desktop tools as instruments of such efforts.  Only
freely-available tools are required in addition to a Windows PC or laptop.
The working language is English. This is how the author is equipped.

While nfoTools are useful independently, they are chosen and developed
first in service of specific software efforts originally housed on
nfoWare.com, nfoWorks.org, and more-recent efforts now on GitHub.
