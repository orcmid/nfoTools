[nfoTools](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools) is a collection of utilities
and software components.  nfoTools are
created in the open on [orcmid GitHub](https://github.com/orcmid/).

nfoTools tools are designed for use in composition of larger software projects
for information-processing applications (and games of course).  nfoTools
can apply anywhere in the complete learning-and-improvement lifecycle of
software projects.

nfoTools are developed and demonstrated using small mini-projects that are
carried out in the GitHub repository and also documented here at
[nfoTools dev](dev/).  [Games](games) are employed for many developments and
the play of games and gaming has an exalted place here.

nfoTools includes a [Toolcraft](tools/) on-ramp that supports beginners who
seek to understand more about programming and the tacit understanding that
experienced software developers rely upon. There are guard rails for
crawling first, then walk, then run as much as desired.

Progressive discloser is used. Skip through details already known.  Review of
the basics when useful along with following links to more advanced cases.

Emphasis is on development of software for Microsoft Windows and using
Microsoft Windows PC desktop tools as instruments of such efforts.  Only
freely-available tools are required in addition to a Windows PC or laptop.
The working language is English.
