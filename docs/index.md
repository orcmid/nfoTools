[nfoTools](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools) is a collection of utilities
and software components.  nfoTools are
created in the open on [orcmid GitHub](https://github.com/orcmid/).

nfoTools tools are designed for use in composition of larger software projects
for information-processing applications (and games of course).  nfoTools
can apply anywhere in the complete learning-and-improvement lifecycle of
software projects.

nfoTools are developed and demonstrated using small mini-projects carried out
in the GitHub repository and documented here on the project website, typically
under [nfoTools dev](dev/).

nfoTools [Games](games) are employed in many demonstrations; the play of games
and gaming have an exalted place here.

nfoTools [Toolcraft](tools/) provides on-ramps for beginners who
seek to understand more about programming and the tacit understanding that
experienced software developers rely upon. There are guard rails for
crawling first, then walking, then running and leaping all you want.

Progressive discloser is used. Skip through details already known.  Review
the basics when useful.  Follow links to more advanced cases.

Emphasis is on development of software for Microsoft Windows and using
Microsoft Windows PC desktop tools as instruments of such efforts.  Only
freely-available tools are required in addition to a Windows PC or laptop.
The working language is English.
