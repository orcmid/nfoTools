# Diary and Job Jar Continued From nfoWare c000000

These kinds of work items are lately kept in TODO sections of text files,
such as [tools.txt](tools.txt).
Those items are removed as they are resolved.  In previous web-based folios,
the job jar was preserved, with resolved items moved to the end of the list.

Either form is a personal-memory extension.  The Diary & Job Jar form has
history independent of the source-code version management. Job Jars are
reviewable without having repository access, whether directly or via a clone.
I rather miss that, although using Markdown in this fashion is not so pleasant
as when I had FrontPage to make these.

One appeal that Job Jars have is that not every entry and action requires
treatment as an additional version.  The progression is reflected in the
material and that is taken as sufficient, in contrast with TODOs being
deleted as part of Git change commits.

 	2013-11-03	Manage across the  top level to the point where the site should be updated.  Bring the structure up to speed with regard to more-recent efforts such as nfoWorks and he Miser Project.
 	2012-12-31	Included correction of URLs, fragment IDs, and titles in the repaving progress.  Propagate through the front porch and bits, construction, data, dev, glossar, images, meaning, notes, projects, text, toolcraft, trust, and xml.
 	2007-08-11	When Toolcraft is ready, make the new nfoWare cover with room for announcement, etc., on the model of NuovoDoc.
in progress	2007-08-04	Initiate review the subordinate construction structures and construction zones for case-sensitivity among page names, URL links, link texts, and text mentions: _private, bits, construction, data, dev, glossary, images, meaning, notes, projects, text, toolcraft, trust, xml
in progress	2007-08-04	While performing reviews, identify any additional adjustments that are required to have consistency with the latest formats, styles, and organization of materials.
 	2007-08-04	Document the construction structure principles under the appropriate template documents so that this is not always being implemented and deviated from memory.
 	2007-08-04	Also make sure there are no-follows in the bottom of everything in the templates.
 	2016-11-10	Switch to Apache License version 2.0.  There is no need to screw around with Creative Commons when the ALv2 is much easier and we can worry about rounding some of its sharp corners some other time.
 	2016-11-02	nfoware.htm: Add gaming/ to the list
 	2016-11-02	Add games/ construction structure for introduction of interactive games, including the cavern set.  Start with the Toolcraft as boilerplate.
 	2012-12-31	Determine if a better LiveSearchSiteAuth.xml file is needed for Bing searching and site administration with regard to search.
 	2012-12-31	Review all folders for their continued function as part of nfoWare.
 	2007-08-11	General rambles in the notes below should be moved to the nfoNotes Diary & Job Jar without waiting for it to be repaved.
 	2004-01-12	Add an index.htm for the eMail messaging section.
 	2004-01-12	Add an eMail section.  This is for confirmable experiences around e-mail and also what is accomplished with it.  One thing to explore is whether eMessage is any different, or a precursor, or what.  [dh:2007-08-08 I wonder if it should be simply "messaging" with e-mail as a special case, working our way up to other kinds of messaging including peer-to-peer and instant messaging, with protocols like XMPP, RSS, and Atom Publishing.  dh:2012-12-31 Yes, messaging and also not about confirmable experience so much as the nfoWare how-to and supporting tools.]
 	2004-01-12	I don't have a good idea of how notes will somehow lead to there being content pages in different sections here, such as bits, data, bytes, pixels, text, meaning, etc. [dh:2007-08-09 We now know that this will be done with the FrontPage Extensions Include Page functionality.  This works at maintenance time and is completely maintainable.  We require nothing special of the hosted-site server.  dh:2012-12-31 The abandonware stat us of Microsoft FrontPage and its inability to work properly from Windows 7 and later clients is going to impact this.]
 	2004-01-12	I want to use eMail as an example of confirmable experience.  Bill and I are having lots of experiences around e-mail security, around signing e-mail, and even simple things like getting e-mail content from one place to another.  I am thinking about how simple it is and how difficult it is to work out.   This also shows up in the context of text.  So I need to figure out how many sections to create here for starters, and what to do about making them confirmable experiences.  I think I will have to do something about this.  [dh:2012-12-31 This probably goes under TROSTing.]
 	2004-01-10	Hmm, where would I deal with anti-virus software and protections like that?  If not here, where?  Certainly trust points with regard to monkeying with files and file systems and running processes (getting launched into memory in various ways - boot sector, programs, startup process, etc.)  [dh:2012-12-31 This is certainly related to trustworthiness and security provision.  There might be some advice about that under toolcraft and setting up development machines.  Forensic work and exploit investigation is off topic, even though some TROST or nfoWorks code may be useful in such endeavors.  Not nfoWare though.  Keep this item until it is reflected elsewhere.]
 	2004-01-08	Bill Anderson said that reviewing the site as it is today brought up things he wants to say there.  We talked about creating places to collaborate using the site.  A wiki, though in the cards, is too hard to bring up on a commercially-hosted server and I want to do something simpler.  One thing I can do is create a subdirectory that has a special user ID for FTP.   Band and Bill Kent (if he chooses to play) could have accounts that provided access to the shared FTP space.  This is actually one of the easiest things to do.  The other step is to create a blog that is mapped to the site from blogger.  This allows us to make notes and to have archives of them, but it doesn't do a lot about creating organized content.  So the challenge here is to come up with something simple for early collaborative activities.  E-mail works now, and we haven't tried much else.  We can do e-mail for now, actually.
 	2004-01-08	I just got off the phone with Bill Anderson.  He suggested "laboratory" for a kind of section.  We're scientists, we need laboratories.  I think that goes in some places, maybe on nfoWare too.  Certainly in the glossary project, and I have added that in the mention from nfoWare.htm.
 	2004-01-08	I need to preserve my writings in a place where the links to them on nfoCentrale sites or publications are at least archived so that I can recover them if ever needed.  That also applies to material that I glean from the Internet and rely on.  I can give credit to the original source, but I also need some way to be able to produce the cited material if it every becomes important to do that.  At the same time, I must not redistribute such material.  Something to work out on Orcmid's Lair as well as here, I think.  [dh:2012-12-31 The practice on nfoWorks is to use cache folders within folios and to use embargoed folders with unpublished names for archiving source materials that are not redistributable.]
 	2004-01-08	I will be referring to Readings and Bibliographies in Orcmid's Lair and elsewhere.  I need to have those pages retrofit to the current nfoCentrale construction styles and practices as being exhibited and updated here.
 	2004-01-08	I have a simple basis for Notes here.  Retrofit this to the Notes on Miser-theory where this came from.
 	2004-01-07	I am writing this here because it is the page I am looking at.  I guess I could have used my notebook, but here I am.  There are topics such as Web and CD-ROM that fit into the electronic publishing that dmWare is.  More to list somewhere.
 	2004-01-07	Will we take on OHS here?  How do we keep this straight separate from Situating XML and also getting into higher levels, such as Situating Documents (which I am willing to do as part of Situating Data just to be ornery).  This can fit into the spiral plan (oh, wow) and it does raise some questions about complete cuts of the dmWare CD as a companion to print versions and as an orderable unit from the web site.
 	2004-01-07	Use the Manning eBook I have to walk myself through the familiarization with .NET and the basic concepts
 	2004-01-07	Install .NET SDK on Compagno in preparation for being able to develop .NET elements for nfoWare. [dh:2012-12-31 I am not certain that I want to do this.  There are interoperability and platform-portability considerations, but I am not at all clear when those arise and how they will be dealt with.  There is also JavaScript to consider now, and the JavaScript use of native libraries too.  In any case, Compagno is the wrong place.]
 	2004-01-02	Since I will be doing open source, how about creating a license that I can name and create a SourceForge project for nfoWare. [dh:2012-12-31 There will be Apache ALv2 and the development of tools will probably be under nfoWorks.][dh:2016-11-02 ALv2 is the license of choice and GitHub is now the preferred location for projects, unless I choose to use Git.  It appears that I can have multiple Git repositories under a single SourceForge project.  That might be useful.]
 	2004-01-02	I supposed cryptography might be appropriate, but code signing certainly is.  Look at whether there needs to be nfoWare as a signature and therefore as a mail alias.  Expand on this.
 	2004-01-02	Create a project around the registration/assertion of naming and the signing of things.  This influences the structure of download materials and also the directories here, for locating javadocs, for locating RSS feeds, for locating other things via identifiers that are issued and used.
 	2004-01-02	Create projects and tracking for a FAQ, support, and downloads section.
 	2004-01-02	Consider whether there should be a wiki here and who should play in it?  Reflect in project or notes activity.  This is certainly an useful place to have discussions on what is data, etc.
