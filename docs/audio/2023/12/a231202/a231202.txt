                     a231202: CAKEWALK.NEXT DAW EXPLORATION
                     --------------------------------------

    Cakewalk.next is the current code name for a new Cakewalk-branded DAW
    from BandLab.  It is on a different trajectory from the interoperating
    legacy Cakewalk products and the pending Sonar.next.

    Cakewalk.next is currently in beta and I am sequestering everything
    about it until the first stable production release is made and I can
    then be accurate.

TODO

 * CXF is a new format that transfers between Cakewalk Next and BandLab
   Sonar.next.  There is also interchange of both CbB and Cnext with the
   online BandLab Studio.

 * I am experimenting with side-by-side of the beta and CbB/Platinum.
   - I have installed it on H:\ to save on SSD.  It installed very quickly,
     so we'll see how it all goes.
   - The activation can go very slowly, with a spinner, until the success
     report comes up.
 * I wanted to specify search locations for VST, VST64, locations to search
   in.  I couldn't see a way to specify more than one location.  When I
   went into the Plugin Manager dialog, I saw it only listed what it knew of
   its own, and there was no way back.
 * It looks like it found all in the single VST directory (with subs) that I
   could give it.  I think that is not all of them.  Especially ones in the
   common location used by SONAR Platinum and CbB.
 * Lost the pop-down about Plugin scanning, but I was able to get the option
   back using Edit | Preferences.
 * I lost the Start screen doing these other things.  I wonder how to get it
   back.
 * I wonder if I give another Custom VST Plugin Location without resetting
   the CWnext catalog, whether the effect is additive.
 * I had to re-open to get the quick-start.
 * LOL.  It has my Praktika selfie at "New Project."  I'm unclear how that
   got there, unless it is on my BandLab profile.
 * The User Manual can be obtained by clicking " Help... on the Help Menu
   pull-down.

 * I want to know if I can get the CWnext beta on my Surface and see how it
   finds anything useful.  This is a DAW-absent machine with no special audio.
   That worked fine!!  It will use the internal Windows devices.  Unclear how
   well it all functions, but it gave me a bare-beginner introduction of
   setup and first-run.

 * I want to know if CWP and CWB files can be imported by CWnext.  If not,
   that's a bummer.  [dh:2023-12-12 There seem's to be no mechanism for this.
   Cnext only exports CXF, into a kind of Zip package and the beta has no way
   to open one.  These are a kind of Zip packaging with an odd file that seems
   to be base64.  The Cakewalk .cwb "Bundle" is an RIFF format binary file.
   It may be that the base64 is a way of encoding the RIFF and making it
   compressible too?  I will need tools to work this out.]

 * The boilerplate is now moved to audio/.  I need to customize it now.

 * I am moving a231202 to a231202/ to have more room to collect material and
   also sequester it from the a000001 until the beta lifts and I have anything
   moderately useful to say.  There is installation and operation and the
   VCrayApp model may work here.

DONE
