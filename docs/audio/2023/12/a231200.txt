TODO

I am going through the Setup process for Cakewalk by BandLab.  It is all
attractive.  The Downloading additional files ... dialog apparently does
a progress bar on each one or something, starting over each time.  I assume
it is not stuck :).

There was automatic detection of some plug-ins, etc., that I already have and
only others are added to the download for CbB.

It appears that CbB does not use the Command Center that the legacy Platinum
works with.  So checking for updates, etc., will be in the app.

I have not gotten to the point where I can make things be side-by-side.

The C:\Program Files\Cakewalk location of Shared Folders is a challenge.
I would prefer to have those on D: or H: where they are shareable without
consuming SSD C:\ space.

Some of the others are fine, such as the VST folder.

The Associating of Files with the Application creates a side-by-side
limitation.  If I apply them to CfB I think I cannot get them back to
Platinum in any sensible manner.

Since I want to demonstrate with CfB, I suppose I can stand this.

The activation process is a bit magical and I can't capture it now.
It turns out that, on the Help Menu apart from Offline Activation, there's
a Sign In to BandLab.  That happens without any remarking except now the
Help Bar has a Sign Out option.  I suspect if I installed on another computer,
I could be signed-in on only one at a time.

I am a little dismayed about the Shared Folders situation.  And some of the
other specified locations that I did not change.  I don't know how much
interop there is between Platinum materials and others.  It may be that there
is considerable overlap.  I don't have shared audio with the Surface, so it
would be difficult to do a pure clean install of CbB there, and it would not
be useful for other reasons.

On the Preferences Audio Settings, there was an odd detection and preference
for the Creative SXFI. I had to remember to Save both the Devices and the
Playback and Recording before the Driver Settings would update.  I left the
Default 44100 for New Projects.

I also ran the Audio Profiler.

The Setup Finish was hidden under the start screen of CbB.  I will save the
installer file that is left in my Downloads folder.

I need to see if I can move the Shared Folders.  I have to check the
Settings to see if that is possible.  dh:2023-12-10T20:26Z.  It's not, there
is no allowance for that location in the Preferences. dh:2023-12-11 No, it is
locked into C:\Program Files\ and nothing to be done for it.

 * There is <https://legacy.cakewalk.com/CakeTV> on tutorials and other
   information.  The SONAR-University/Get-Started section is not very
   elementary.  This seems more like learning what's change as new features
   were introduced in SONAR.  These seem to be in most-recent-first
   organization, so there may be ideas to gain from the older materials, even
   if based on older SONAR versions.

 * Music Creator is apparently a Cakewalk introductory DAW.  It looks very
   much like Cakewalk.

 * There are some nice videos on Blog Bytes also.

 * I Installed BandLab Assistant.  I'm uncertain that it is worthwhile except
   that's where update information might appear.

 * Really want a simple way to handle
   - download
   - setup process
   - I need to do this on a bare machine that does not have any previous
     installs or particular settings.  I go default all the way and see how
     it goes.  That does leave a challenge for audio setup though.  I may
     have to come back to the setup for audio that I went through.
   - There is the first-run business and how nice it is with CbB.
   - Then needing to open a bundle and confirm operation is working.

 * Then get into the beginner usage cases.  Simple things from the very
   beginning.

 * I do need resources much like the way I propose to go after C Language
   programming.

 * Videos of Cakewalk Tutorials,
 <https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=cakewalk+tutorials>.  Many videos.
 I need to curate these.

 * About Cakewalk Next (beta), <https://youtu.be/8E_PGhxbCe8> 258 page
   manual.  Almost 1,000 pages in Cakewalk manual (CbB?).

 * CXF is a new format that transfers between Cakewalk Next and Cakewalk
   SONAR.  There may be Cakewalk Next for the Mac, and CXF will work with
   those too.  Oh, this is by John Vere.  Old guy like me.  All of this is
   about the UX and not so much about how to use it.

 * I need to get the beta of CWnext.  See how it works along with CbB.  Oh,
   cool!  They are doing it with a Cakewalk Next server on Discord.

 * I am experimenting with side-by-side of the beta and CbB/Platinum.
   - I have installed it on H:\ to save on SSD.  It installed very quickly,
     so we'll see how it all goes.
   - The activation can go very slowly, with a spinner, until the success
     report comes up.
 * I wanted to specify search locations for VST, VST64, locations to search
   in.  I couldn't see a way to specify more than one location.  When I
   went into the Plugin Manager dialog, I saw it only listed what it knew of
   its own, and there was no way back.
 * It looks like it found all in the single VST directory (with subs) that I
   could give it.  I think that is not all of them.  Especially ones in the
   common location used by SONAR Platinum and CbB.
 * Lost the pop-down about Plugin scanning, but I was able to get the option
   back using Edit | Preferences.
 * I lost the Start screen doing these other things.  I wonder how to get it
   back.
 * I wonder if I give another Custom VST Plugin Location without resetting
   the CWnext catalog, whether the effect is additive.
 * I had to re-open to get the quick-start.
 * LOL.  It has my Praktika selfie at "New Project."  I'm unclear how that
   got there, unless it is on my BandLab profile.
 * The User Manual can be obtained by clicking " Help... on the Help Menu
   pull-down.

 * I want to know if I can get the CWnext beta on my Surface and see how it
   finds anything useful.  This is a DAW-absent machine with no special audio.
   That worked fine!!  It will use the internal Windows devices.  Unclear how
   well it all functions, but it gave me a bare-beginner introduction of
   setup and first-run.

 * I want to know if CWP and CWB files can be imported by CWnext.  If not,
   that's a bummer.  [dh:2023-12-12 There seem's to be no mechanism for this.
   Cnext only exports CXF, into a kind of Zip package and the beta has no way
   to open one.  These are a kind of Zip packaging with an odd file that seems
   to be base64.  The Cakewalk .cwb "Bundle" is an RIFF format binary file.
   It may be that the base64 is a way of encoding the RIFF and making it
   compressible too?  I will need tools to work this out.]

 * The boilerplate is now moved to audio/.  I need to customize it now.
