                            BOULDER CREEK RHAPSODY
                            ======================

As an exercise in creating music with a Digital Audio Workstation and all of
the digital tools and software that I have for that purpose, I am thinking of
a Boulder Creek Rhapsody, based on the forest fire, mud and flood, and
expected recovery.  I favor cinematic forms.

I have had too many Digital Audio Workstations and am now down to using only
Ableton Live 11 Lite, which is free for me.  I have tons of add-ons, including
much from Native Instruments, the source of my computer's audio dock.

I also have legacy Cakewalk SONAR Platinum and Cakewalk by BandLab.  I am
keeping an eye on Cakewalk.next and BandLab Studio.  The Clegacy CakeWalk may
be the best selection, since I can use all of the Native Instrument plug-ins
and instruments with legacy Cakewalk.

Ableton may have messed up the tutorials for Live Lite and I am waiting to see
if there will be a Live 12 Lite update available.  We'll see.

I am just getting started.

MANIFEST

    Boulder-Creek-2024-01-02.txt
        More from Co-Pilot on Sonata and Rhapsody forms.  I forgot where I
        had ths material already and went on the Internet again.

    BoulderCreekForm.txt
        A text file of my research into symphonic forms, useful in the choice
        of "rhapsody" and also useful in determining some of the details.

    NativeInstruments-MelodicTechno-2024-01-07_files/
        Capture of NI Tutorial on MelodicTechno with a lesson on building
        such a song.  Some of the ideas may apply here, although this will
        not be dance.  Umm, so far as I know.

TODO

 * Listen to "Rhapsody in Blue" and the other Gerschwin I like for more
   understanding of the form.

 * Listen to the Liszt "Hungarian Rhapsodies" for understanding of the form.

 * Listen to Rachmaninoff "Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini" for more sense.

 * Do the Native instruments Melodic Techno tutorial to see what I can do
   to be more in a rhapsody form.

 * THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY CLEAN C.  This needs to go under Audio of
   nfoTools.

DONE

 2023-01-07 Nothing to See here.  Move Along.
