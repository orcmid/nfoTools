     AUTHOR NOTE: THIS IS MATERIAL SCAVENGED FROM A231200.txt.
            IT IS NOT FULLY REFACTORED/REPURPOSED YET.

TODO

 * I want emphasis on free or nearly-free decent quality tools for novices,
   with ways to advance as desired.

   - That may include CbB, Ableton Live Lite, and maybe Cakewalk.next.

   - The focus is on Windows PC and the desktop, as usual for nfoTools.  There
     may be a counterbalance in respect to materials and courses that assume
     use of Macintosh software.

   - Also, with VST64, etc., there are many supporting instruments and tools
     to be had, including Komplete Starter, etc.

 * It might be interesting to address Trackers, and maybe more on MIDI, but
   not by much.

 * Locating and arranging use of Windows organization will matter.  Also the
   sharing of plug-in (VST3, etc.) locations for searching is also valuable.

 * Operating side-by-side can be an issue and that may need to be understood
   for all products addressed here.

 * I remember the "beep" command-line tool.  It would be nice to replicate
   that.  Also, one that uses audio clips would be cool as well.

   And of course, anything by Larry Osterman. It's great that blog is
   preserved at learn.microsoft.com,
   https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/larryosterman/
   (ends in 2015)

 * There are also Trackers, and MIDI to ponder.  SoundForge too I suppose.
   This goes back to when I had an E-MU audio card.

 * There's also Minaudio and David Reid's work, not just Ramon on raylib.

 * And all of the compression, packaging, bundling things.  That's not
   exclusively here, so maybe there's another place for that than audio/
   but it is an interesting, challenging area.  RIFF as well as Zip, but we
   can go back to TAR files and other approaches to having bundles in file
   systems (like at IBM and Univac).

 * I need to determine how retro I want to get.  That is, do I want to do
   much with CbB, even though I suspect it will be free for a while longer.
   And I probably can leave Cakewalk SONAR Platinum alone until is is clear
   what BandLab is going to do for SONAR.next.

 * I also need to move this to c000000.htm and have a preserved diary.

 * Then make this a tombstone that explains that and more.

  * https://www.soundtrap.com/musicmakers seems to be advertised as a
    challenger to Adobe Audition and Ableton.  It is all subscription based
    with different levels for categories (including "All").  It also claims
    to be a Protools Alternative.  There appear to be some great tutorials.
    Needs more-careful scrutiny.
