In music, a rhapsody is a one-movement work that is episodic yet integrated,
free-flowing in structure, featuring a range of highly contrasted moods,
color, and tonality. It is characterized by an air of spontaneous inspiration
and a sense of improvisation, making it freer in form than a set of
variations. The word "rhapsody" is derived from the Greek word "rhapsōidia,"
which means "recitation of selections from epic poetry".

The rhapsody form has been used by many composers throughout history,
including Johannes Brahms, George Gershwin, and Sergei Rachmaninoff. Some
famous examples of rhapsodies include:
- Rhapsody in Blue by George Gershwin, which is a jazz-influenced rhapsody for
  piano and orchestra .
- Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 by Franz Liszt, which is a virtuosic piano piece
  that incorporates Hungarian folk melodies .
- Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini by Sergei Rachmaninoff, which is a set of 24
  variations on a theme by Niccolò Paganini for piano and orchestra.

A sonata is a type of musical composition that usually consists of two to four
movements, each in a related key but with a unique musical character. The
term "sonata" originally denoted a composition played on instruments, as
opposed to one that was cantata, or "sung," by voices. Its first such use was
in 1561, when it was applied to a suite of dances for lute.

The sonata form has been used by many composers throughout history, including
Ludwig van Beethoven, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Johann Sebastian Bach, Joseph
Haydn, and Franz Schubert . Most frequently, it refers to such a piece for one
or two instruments, such as Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata (1801) for piano. By
extension, sonata can also refer to a composition for a larger instrumental
group having more than two or three parts, such as a string quartet or an
orchestra, provided that the composition is based on principles of musical
form that from the mid-18th century were used in sonatas for small
instrumental groups .

From Britannica:
Most first movements of Classical sonatas are in sonata form, and they are
usually fast; the second movement commonly provides the contrast of a slower
tempo; and the last movement in most cases is again fast. When there are four
movements, a simpler, dance-style movement of the type also found in the suite
is included. This is usually placed between the slow second movement and the
finale; in some cases it stands second and the slow movement third.
