# ***N210901:** Tacit Knowledge and the Beginner Mind*

## Skills: The Importance of What We Know and Forgot We Learned It

Computer specialists and programmers, information-technology practitioners,
possess considerable tacit knowledge.  That's knowledge that is unspoken and
applied automatically without thought.  Sometimes we call it muscle memory.
It is ready-to-hand, always available, and effortless.  Maybe not so much
when the technology or tools change and our
attachment to a particular toolcraft is challenged.  Then we might champion
ours, clinging to it for comfort and confidence.  Are you a
Mac or a PC?  A *nix adherent?  BMW, Lincoln, or Lexus?

It is difficult for tacit-knowers to convey that knowledge and to see
how to instruct others in acquiring it.  Explaining themselves to others is
challenging.  This happens regularly in life, say when a parent attempts to
teach a teen-ager how to drive an automobile or to ride a bicycle.  Or when
a youngster attempts to instruct an older person, or another youngster, in
something they take for granted.  Likewise, consider when software experts
create videos that display extensive unexplained tacit knowledge too rapidly
for the less-knowledgable to recognize, let alone comprehend.  There is an
important difference between a lesson and a performance.

## The Forgetfulness of Learning

I don't remember learning to walk or learning to speak?  Do you?  I do recall
learning to catch a thrown ball, after overcoming my fear of being struck.  I
also overcame a fear of dogs, something I needed to do in order to bicycle
over a newspaper delivery route.  Learning to go from wading to swimming was
also something I had to be taught.  Diving into water was more challenging
until it wasn't.  Your list may vary. I suspect you have a list though.

I do remember learning to read and some of learning to write, especially the
tedious early practices.  Arithmetic came the same way, moving from struggle
to delight in geometry and algebra, until advancing in mathematics became
challenging once again at the collegiate level.  I have been a beginner or
amateur in mathematical-logic for my entire adult life.  Just don't regale me
about category theory if it is tacit for you and you expect osmosis into my
brain.  There was much about computers and software that I did not understand
at first, although I was fortunate to being at a time when computers were
much simpler than now.  I had the luxury of following along as Computer
Science was starting up and growing over time, not fed to me in too-short
focused curricula.

I gave up on ballroom dancing in my teen years.  It was embarassing and
awkward.  In my 50s, I had the good fortune of taking group ballroom dancing
lessons in a club that treasured beginners, providing great guidance at low
cost.  I and a few friends who wanted to learn thrived in that place.  I also
learned that many young women were as timid and anxious about learning to
dance as I had been as a boy.

I need to develop tacit skills now, years later, in
dance-based exercise classes on Zoom.  My attempts to directly mimic
the instructor are insufficient unless I recognize and learn the multi-step
patterns; then I can apply them effortlessly when I see one begin. Here
muscle memory is part of the fitness achievement.  It is also very clear when
an in-person exercise instructor is performing and not
teaching, not attending to us.  The best
manage that on-line in-person; I have been fortunate to experience the best.

## Beginner Mind: Uncovering the Tacit

When I see courses or projects that are invitations to beginners, I tend to
bring what I call my beginner mind to it.  I want to see how instruction is
done in my field, and I want to see how learning is fostered thereby.  I
look from the perspective of not knowing it already, although I am able to
notice deficiencies and understand what is omitted.  In the case of
open-source projects, I also notice the barriers to arrival of newcomers in
so many.

It was startling to me, recently, to observe how much tacit knowledge was
left unrecognized in some online courses in their introducitons for beginners.
In bringing my beginner mind to appraisal of those courses, I realized how
many of _my_ tacit understandings were at play.  I have been noticing even
more lately.

I want any project of mine to provide a meaningful on-ramp for engagement of
curious novices.  This section of ***nfoTools*** documentation is devoted to
the unconcealing of tacit knowledge, making its prerequisite occurrence
explicit.

I cannot cover all of the cases with anything in depth.  I propose to identify
the various skills that software developers master and articulate the tacit
understanding enough that it can be pursued by the curious and patient.

I desire that other experts and near-experts consider how they can capture
their own tacit understandings and add some hospitality for eager newcomers.

There is a new kind of opportunity here.  There is much usually-invisible
technology underneath the computer interactions we have.  There are
alternative cases that we tend to be ignorant about.  In seeing what is
tacit for us, perhaps we can then embrace the variety that is otherwise
invisible as well and serve others better.
