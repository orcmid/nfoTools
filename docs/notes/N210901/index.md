## Skills: The Importance of What We Know and Forgot We Learned It

Computer specialists and programmers, information-technology practitioners,
possess considerable tacit knowledge.  That's knowledge that is unspoken and
applied automatically without thought.  Sometimes we call it muscle memory.
It is ready-to-hand, always available, and effortless.  Maybe not so much
when the technology or tools change and our
attachment to a particular toolcraft is challenged.  Then we might champion
ours, clinging to it for comfort and confidence.  Are you a
Mac or a PC?  A *nix adherent?  BMW, Lincoln, or Lexus admirer?

Maybe it should not be called knowledge if we don't know we have it?  It is
a kind of bias too, intrinsic or simply unconscious.

It is difficult for tacit-knowers to convey that knowledge and to see
how to instruct others in acquiring it.  Explaining themselves to others is
challenging.  This happens regularly in life, say when a parent attempts to
teach a teen-ager how to drive an automobile or to ride a bicycle.  Or when
a youngster attempts to instruct an older person, or another youngster, in
something they take for granted.  Likewise, consider when software experts
create videos that display extensive unexplained tacit knowledge too rapidly
for the less-knowledgable to recognize, let alone comprehend and keep up with
what they are being "shown."  There is an important difference between a
lesson and a performance.

## The Forgetfulness of Learning

I don't remember learning to walk or learning to speak.  Do you?  I do recall
learning to catch a thrown ball, after overcoming my fear of being struck.  I
overcame a fear of dogs, something I needed to do in order to bicycle
over a newspaper delivery route. I also remember learning to ride a bicycle.
The bicycle was full-sized and I wasn't.
Learning to go from wading to swimming was
also something I had to be taught.  Diving into water was more challenging
until it wasn't.  Your list may vary. I suspect you have a list though.

I do remember learning to read and some of learning to write, especially the
tedious early practices.  Arithmetic came the same way, moving from struggle
to delight in geometry and algebra, until advancing in mathematics became
challenging once again at the collegiate level.  I have been a beginner or
amateur in mathematical-logic for my entire adult life.  Just don't regale me
about category theory if it is tacit for you and you expect osmosis into my
brain.

I've learned to type at least twice.  Once was in a high-school typing class
and my first portabe manual typewriter.  The second was learning to type
program code into punched cards.  Electric typewriters and computer keyboards
were easier to master, although there are keys that I can't touch-type on
full keyboards, and I am struggling with the differences of an ergonomic
keyboard setup.

There was much about computers and software that I did not understand
at first, although I was fortunate to it being a time when digital computers
were much simpler than now.  I had the luxury of following along as Computer
Science was starting up and developing over time, not fed to me in too-short
focused curricula.

I gave up on ballroom dancing in my teen years.  It was embarassing and
awkward.  In my 50s, I had the good fortune of taking group ballroom dancing
lessons in a club that treasured beginners, providing great guidance at low
cost.  I and a few friends who wanted to learn thrived in that place.  I also
learned that many young women were as timid and anxious about learning to
dance as I had been as a boy.

I need to develop tacit skills now, years later, in
dance-based exercise classes on Zoom.  My attempts to directly mimic
the instructor are insufficient unless I recognize and learn the multi-step
patterns; then I can apply them effortlessly when I see recurrences. Here
muscle memory is part of the fitness achievement.  It is also very clear when
an in-person exercise instructor is performing and not
teaching, not attending to us.  The best instructors
manage student-awareness even in Zoom delivery. I have been fortunate to
experience the best instructors for me as an active older adult.

## Beginner Mind: Uncovering the Tacit

When I see courses or projects that are invitations to beginners, I tend to
bring what I call my beginner mind to it.  I want to see how instruction is
done in my field, and I want to see how learning is fostered thereby.  I
look from the perspective of not knowing it already, although I am able to
notice deficiencies and understand what is omitted because I _am_ experienced.
The trick is for me to let my beginner mind appraise the unsaid, relying on my
expertise to then understand the missing connections of the skimpy dots.

It was startling, recently, to observe how much tacit knowledge was
left unrecognized in some online courses in their introductions for beginners.
In bringing my beginner mind to appraisal of those courses, I realized how
many of _my_ tacit understandings were at play.  I have been noticing [even
more lately](../N220201).

I want any project of mine to provide a meaningful on-ramp for engagement of
curious novices.  The [skills section](../../skills) of ***nfoTools***
documentation is devoted to unconcealing of tacit knowledge involved in
fluency with computers generally, making the tacitly-overlooked prerequisites
for use of a PC explicit.  Specific, narrower toolcraft needed to engage with
nfoTools at a technical level is addressed in the
[tools section](../../tools).

Experts and near-experts might consider from these efforts how they can
capture their own tacit understandings and add some hospitality for eager
newcomers.

## The Opportunity of Broadening Context

Tacit understanding undermines our awareness of alternative and different
arrangements that are also worthy of attention.  Seeing what is tacit for us,
becoming self-conscious about it, provides an opening for identification and
distinction of cases that remain invisible otherwise.

There are many examples of this situation, from assuming that everyone is
comfortable with English, to recognizing that our favorite ASCII-inspired
keyboards are not universal and there are more devices and character codings
than the ones we see individually in common use.  Recognize from there how
to introduce greater adaptivity in what we produce and how we present it.

There is also opportunity to gain some mastery over how the underlying
technology is not wedded literally to what we perceive as its surface
functionality.  This is an area of engineering success, right down to the
electronic "bits," that can be appreciated and also conquered by those
enthralled enough about it.

In such ways, distinction of tacitness provides an opportunity to discern even
greater reach in approaches to our work.
