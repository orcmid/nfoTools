## 1. Overview

For deeper, practical understanding of nfoWorks topics, it is important to
work with a personal computer and available software tools.  Some tools are
provided with nfoTools.  Other tools are recommended.  Additional tools are
required for building the nfoWare tools, if you choose to go that far.  To
explore, construct, and modify the nfoWare tools, you'll need an understanding
of the tools that are used to do that.  That's where Toolcraft comes in.

### 1.1 Toolcraft is about Craft

Toolcraft is about the peculiar details of different families of computer and
software tools.  Although you might understand the concepts of such tools,
working smoothly with them requires fluency in the associated toolcraft.

Toolcraft is not often recognized as such.  Toolcraft is simply understood to
some degree by those who have been immersed in it.  To a practitioner, it is
automatic.  To an observer, it is all mystery and error-prone dangers.

Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows users live and operate in different
toolcrafts.  Unix and GNU/Linux users have yet another set, as do Java
developers.  In my early career, there were quite different toolcrafts,
including everyday technical language and nomenclature, between programmers
for Univac systems and programmers for other computers, whether from IBM,
Burroughs, or many other, mainly long-forgotten, computer manufacturers.

Toolcraft and its automatic and reflex-like reliance is a barrier to
communication and shared understanding.  Practitioners often don't realize
that they have picked up a toolcraft, and are actually unable to explain it
to others (not unlike a parent attempting to teach another family member to
operate an automobile).  In addition, toolcraft interferes with recognition
of the common principles, practices, and fundamental concepts of
information processing.

It doesn't seem possible to eliminate toolcraft.  Instead, here are tutorials
and documentation that supports initial experience and self-guided exploration
of some popular toolcraft.  In seeing the principles behind a few toolcrafts,
you may find it easier to recognize and teach yourself other ones.  Here are
the main topics identified so far.  You'll quickly notice that nfoWare has
some of its own toolcraft:

There's no craft like toolcraft craft.

"As craft work, knowledge work fits more into apprenticeship learning models
than in conventional training approaches. Making the work process and its
intermediate products more visible will make the apprenticeship process more
effective."

to make the process of knowledge work less visible just when we need it to be
more so."
