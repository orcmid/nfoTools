# ***N070801: The Craft in Toolcraft***

## Diary and Job Jar from nfoWare T070801a

| ***Status YYYY/MM/DD*** | ***YYYY/MM/DD*** | ***Description*** |
|      :-:     |   :-:      |       ---         |
| | 2017-03-05 | Review structure of default versus a toolcraft.htm page.  Get the construction links to work right.  See how this is done on nfoWorks. |
| | 2017-03-05 | Add ClustrMap to the document-engineering in a proper way. |
| | 2001-11-29 | Toolcraft related to my life themes: "I dream of computer technology and programming being accessible to anyone: using the technology itself to support people in exploring and mastering as much as they choose;  using the technology to be less inscrutable and more open to investigation and understanding by computer users.  I'm particularly taken by the idea of having support for customization and programming of our computers be available for anyone to partake of whenever it's needed, for as much as it's needed, and as long as it holds our interest." |
| | 2005-12-24 | t070801 and the toolcraft.htm page: I need to differentiate between info, notes, dev, and toolcraft.   I think the information about installing Visual C++ 2005 Express and other tools is definitely about Toolcraft and I could put it there.  I am of two minds about that versus having it be part of the downloadable part of dev.  I am inclined to go with Toolcraft for now, and using T-notes, which can eventually be tied to specific dependencies via centrale M-notes and strumenti S-notes on Orcmid's Lair. \[dh:2007-08-31 The toolcraft structure is it.  This allows citation from other places where it is applied, but it is in toolcraft as support for general fluency.\]\[dh:2007-08-31 This is from the notes diary.\] |
| | 2007-08-31 | Tie to the notions around concepts in Fluency with Information Technology: compare fluency, abstraction, and being operationally attuned. |
| | 2007-08-30 | Bring toolcraft-specific items from the toolcraft/ catalog and job jar to this page. \[dh:2007-08-31 check the notes diary too.\] |
| | 2007-08-30 | Make a toolcraft logo that we can use.  This may end up being an nfoWare logo for now, but it probably needs to be smaller than the front-porch one. |
| | 2007-08-30 | Replace the toolcraft/default.htm page with a portal-like page |
| | 2007-08-30 | Update the catalog to reflect the availability of t070801 |
| | 2007-08-30 | t070801: Provide an appropriately-balanced folio cover |
| | 2007-08-30 | Get the document-engineering button and the style used on NuovoDoc.  I may want to change color schemes though.  This definitely calls for a template, but I am not going to do that right away. |
| | 2007-08-24 | The toolcraft default page contains material that should be reflected in a separate page about toolcraft, the craft of toolcraft, etc., page.  The default page should provide an entrance and on-ramp in the manner of a home page, or the ODMdev entrance page. |
| | 2007-08-10 | There is a Coding Horror post relevant to the toolcraft situation too. |
| | 2007-08-09 | t070801: Capture a link to the Coding Horror post that is related to this theme too. |
| | 2005-12-28 | It would be nice to post something about this and forward this particular Toolcraft conversation and distinction. |
| | 2005-12-28 | Simon Phipp's 2005-12-22 SunMink post on "Closing the Experience Gap" is also relevant to the toolcraft discussions. |
| | 2005-12-28 | Jimmy Nillson's 2005-12-28 Architecture post on "English Common" is relevant to toolcraft discussions. |
| | 2005-12-26 | Notebook #49.37 has some ideas about the nature of toolcraft and how insidious it is. |
| | 2004-01-30 | Another aspect of the toolcraft situation is the tension between innovation and the desire for predictability and preservation.  The diseconomies and the issues of education and training and maintenance of expertise and capability are somehow relevant in this sphere, though I don't know of a great way to illustrate this tension and the risks of local optimization creating global failures.  I have re-connected with Ted Smith and he seems to have something to offer in this area.  Include placeholders for this too.  \[dh:2007-08-31 from the nfoWare notes/ job jar.\] |
| | 2004-01-30 | I realize, in reviewing the toolcraft index page that the original toolcraft is language (which ones we speak and are literate in) as well as the special vocabularies of craft work.  I should reflect that in those notes and also consider the Tower of Babel implications.  Include placeholders for this.  \[dh:2007-08-31 from the nfoWare notes/ job jar.\] |
