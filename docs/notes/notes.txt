                          ----------------------

    nfoTools docs/notes/ is a collection of notes on topics that are separate
    from the account of developments, tools, and skills.  The pattern of
    chronological cataloguing is the same as for the other three, using
    N-prefixed folios/pages.

TODO

 * Replicate the nfoware.com/notes/ structure and purpose as well as possible.

 * Migrate some materials for here for preservation, maintaining the previous
   identifiers where appropriate.

 * There is a little bit of Professor von Clueless in the Blunder Dome maybe?
   Or even Spanner Wingnut in the Muddleware Labs. No, I think that is under
   Tools and Dev.  Can talk about them here maybe.

 * I want an icon for Notes pages and a counterpart of the folio format being
   slowly introduced at dev/ and tools/.

 * Make a project about Notes migration and also refactoring between notes,
   dev, and tools.

 * Bring nfoWare/meaning here and massage into a not.  Recognizing abstraction
   might also be an important skill.

 * The nfoWare/glossary is a kind of project.  I am uncertain where it goes.
   It is certainly nfoWare.

 * Do we need nfoWare/gaming, and what about recreational computing?  I guess
   the chess king image would go well there though.

 * Bring over the nfoWare/notes/n000000 catalog and also look into
   transposition of existing notes:
   o n040100 Bootstrapping Confirmable Experience (definitely here and also
     a skill maybe)
   o n040200 Situating Confirmable Experience - depending
   o n040201 Confirmable Scholarship - I think that is about provenance and
     attribution, identifiable and locatable, those things.
   o n060201 Creative Commons License - probably more of a Construction matter
     although ideas about licenses and what they mean, top=level TL;DR and
     maybe deed-style?
   o n131101 Literate Updown is a docEng project, methinks
   o n270201 SemFix is a tool-level thing, and a practice.  Need to split out
     a Patterns and/or Practices thingie?
