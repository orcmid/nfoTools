                          NFOTOOLS PROJECT NOTES
                          ----------------------

    nfoTools docs/notes/ is a collection of notes on topics that are separate
    from the account of specific developments, tools, and skills.  The pattern
    of yymmddx chronological cataloguing is the same as for the other three,
    using N-prefixed folios/pages.

    Notes can be broader, incidental, or simply meta-discussions regarding
    the overal nature of nfoTools and their utiilization, especially with
    regard to information-technology and software-engineering lore.

TODO

 * Replicate the nfoware.com/notes/ structure and purpose as well as possible.

 * Migrate some materials for here for preservation, maintaining the previous
   identifiers where appropriate.

 * There is a little bit of Professor von Clueless in the Blunder Dome maybe?
   Or even Spanner Wingnut in the Muddleware Labs. No, I think that is under
   Tools and Dev.  Can talk about them here maybe.

 * I want an icon for Notes pages and a counterpart of the folio format being
   slowly introduced at dev/ and tools/.

 * Make a project about Notes migration and also refactoring between notes,
   dev, and tools.

 * Bring nfoWare/meaning here and massage into a not.  Recognizing abstraction
   might also be an important skill.

 * The nfoWare/glossary is a kind of project.  I am uncertain where it goes.
   It is certainly nfoWare.

 * The games/ section here is about game implementations.  It is tools and
   maybe notes that address gamedev.  Gaming and recreational computing are
   yet another category, whether under one category or not.  Choose.

 * Bring over the nfoWare/notes/n000000 catalog and also look into
   transposition of existing notes:
   o n040100 Bootstrapping Confirmable Experience (definitely here and also
     a skill maybe)
   o n040200 Situating Confirmable Experience - depending
   o n040201 Confirmable Scholarship - I think that is about provenance and
     attribution, identifiable and locatable, those things.
   o n060201 Creative Commons License - probably more of a Construction matter
     although ideas about licenses and what they mean, top=level TL;DR and
     maybe deed-style?
   o n131101 Literate Updown is a docEng project, methinks
   o n270201 SemFix is a tool-level thing, and a practice.  Need to split out
     a Patterns and/or Practices thingie?

 * Use N220201 For identifying my own Beginner Mind fails, having way too many
   tacit understandings that don't even stand out for me.

 * Account for N220201 as related material for N210901 and maybe N070801 too.
