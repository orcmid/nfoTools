                          NFOTOOLS PROJECT NOTES
                          ----------------------

    nfoTools docs/notes/ is a collection of notes on topics that are separate
    from the account of specific developments, tools, and skills.  The pattern
    of yymmddx chronological cataloguing is the same as for the other three,
    using N-prefixed folios/pages.

    Notes can be broader, incidental, or simply meta-discussions regarding
    the overal nature of nfoTools and their utiilization, especially with
    regard to information-technology and software-engineering lore.

TODO

 * I need to have a note on my dilletante ambitions with request to digital
   music, the situation with wanting free tools to talk about, and the
   difficulty with Ableton Live Lite 11 (soon to be 12?) and also the whole
   challenge with Cakewalk up to SONAR and my fumbling with the changeover to
   BandLab.

 * Have been reinstalling SONAR where the legacy.cakewalk.com and the
   Command Center are now operating.  Apparently, because of registry
   settings, the re-installed Command Center indicated that a large variety
   of components, including the core SONAR software, was already present.
   I have re-installed some of them.  There are some product that, such as
   Melodyne 2 Essentials and D-Pro that don't give me enough control over
   where to install them.  That's Worrisome.

 * I am going through the CbB Cakewalk by BandLab setup now.  We'll see how
   it all goes.

 * I want to have a folio on this subject.  I also want to have it on the
   intended hybrid structure here under nfoTools Notes.  I am very baffled
   with my efforts concerning Ableton Live Lite and Cakewalk SONAR.  I want
   to focus on any free version of Cakewalk so long as BandLab supports it.
   IMPORTANT: While I may have notes about this, and an audio section of
   docs/, along with games/, I must get clear on

 * Migrate some materials for here for preservation, maintaining the previous
   identifiers where appropriate.  There are two situations here.  First,
   putting in the Construction Structure and having it work.  There is also
   a model here for how to do this in dev/ and other places.  That is, have
   d000000.htm for Diary & Job Jar, d000001.htm if necessary.  This seems to
   work better while not mushing everything into Construction Zones.  I need
   to take that into other areas of Orcmid on GitHub to handle all this
   better.

 * There is a little bit of Professor von Clueless in the Blunder Dome maybe?
   Or even Spanner Wingnut in the Muddleware Labs. No, I think that is under
   Tools and Dev.  Can talk about them here maybe.

 * I want an icon for Notes pages and a counterpart of the folio format being
   slowly introduced at dev/ and tools/.

 * Make a project about Notes migration and also refactoring between notes,
   dev, and tools.

 * Bring nfoWare/meaning here and massage into a note.  Recognizing
   abstraction might also be an important skill.  YESSSSSSS

 * The nfoWare/glossary is a kind of project.  I am uncertain where it goes.
   It is certainly nfoWare.

 * Games as play as well as games to make needs to be covered over ther.

 * Bring over the nfoWare/notes/n000000 catalog and also look into
   transposition of existing notes:  GET BACK INTO THIS
   o n040100 Bootstrapping Confirmable Experience (definitely here and also
     a skill maybe)
   o n040200 Situating Confirmable Experience - depending
   o n040201 Confirmable Scholarship - I think that is about provenance and
     attribution, identifiable and locatable, those things.
   o n060201 Creative Commons License - probably more of a Construction matter
     although ideas about licenses and what they mean, top=level TL;DR and
     maybe deed-style?
   o n131101 Literate Updown is a docEng project, methinks
   o n270201 SemFix is a tool-level thing, and a practice.  Need to split out
     a Patterns and/or Practices thingie?

 * Build a table on the ACM Turing Award recipients and the areas of their
   contributions.  Also find a way to link to or rely on information about the
   recipients and especially their work.  This could be under Astraendo, but
   I like the idea of it being here for the attention of novices and
   developers early in their careers.

 * Add N220500 On Logic for Computer Science
   This is intended for LogTeach-22: LICS 2022 Workshop on Why and how to
   teach Logic for CS undergraduates?
   <https://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~janos/LogTeach-22/>.  A short position
   paper is required by 2022-05-30.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED HERE.  I NEED
   TO PUT MY POSITION MATERIAL ON-LINE AND ALSO TIE IT INTO OTHER THINGS,
   SUCH AS SKILLS AS WELL AS INTRODUCTION OF BOOLEAN STUFF.

 * THERE IS MUCH MORE TO SAY ABOUT COMPUTING, PROGRAMMING, AND THE DIFFERENCE
   AMONG/WITHIN COMPUTER SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS.

 * "IN DEFENSE OF PHILOSOPHY"  Defense not really required, but appreciation
   might be the actual issue.  And from appreciation of it being about good
   questions, not particular answers, we can also consider more how we are
   in unsafe territory when claiming refuge in the certainty of belief.

 * Change the current (nfoTools on GitHub) exposed notes to hybrid format.

 * Bring over topics on what language and what kind of software development
   here.  Contrast with approaches here.   Sounds like two notes.  Then they
   can be usefully referenced from more focused tools and dev notes.  See
   T060101.txt for example.
