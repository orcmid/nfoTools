                          ----------------------

    nfoTools docs/notes/ is a collection of notes on topics that are separate
    from the account of developments, tools, and skills.  The pattern of
    chronological cataloguing is the same as for the other three, using
    N-prefixed folios/pages.

TODO

 * Replicate the nfoware.com/notes/ structure and purpose as well as possible.

 * Migrate some materials for here for preservation, maintaining the previous
   identifiers where appropriate.

 * There is a little bit of Professor von Clueless in the Blunder Dome maybe?
   Or even Spanner Wingnut in the Muddleware Labs.
