        <small>I had this insight while on the rowing machine.&nbsp; The     
        pull-down menus for things like configuration options and other     
        selections should have links for help on the very item.&nbsp; There     
        should be no need to do something special to get context-sensitive     
        help.&nbsp; That should also work.&nbsp; Likewise, dialog boxes should     
        provide easy ways to get expanded information about what the choices are     
        about and the consequences of choices.&nbsp; There is more about     
        offering someone the choice of exercising an option, and also ways to     
        undo it, etc.&nbsp; This may depend on the path to the explanation, but     
        as long as the choice is consistent with the context, it should be     
        offered.&nbsp; I also was thinking about how to mayble have a little     
        icon to signify the presence of help on a menu item too.&nbsp; So it is     
        clear that the item is not being selected.&nbsp; There are some     
        important human factors to this.&nbsp; Also ways to have it work     
        portably between different toolcrafts.</small>

        <small>This week in my Computer Networking course, we are looking at      
        more routing, optimization, and other activities.&nbsp; These topics are      
        good for <i>Situating Java</i>.&nbsp; The heuristic quality, and the      
        need for simulations, statistics, and analysis is fascinating.&nbsp;      
        This can also be illustrated with games, and it would be good to have a      
        tie-in to play, multiplayer gaming, and basic gaming (like chess).&nbsp;

        <small>I had been thinking, in the last day or so, that it might be all

        not knowing what the artists experience was, say in making a cave           
        painting, since we have no common conceptual framework even, that we can

        <small>Recent work in physiology and the brain suggests that our                         
        visualizations and conceptualizations tend to be tied to spatial                         
        awareness and physical (body) actions.&nbsp; It occurred                         
        to me that dreams are like that, and even when I was working on a                         
        symbolic problem (just getting immersed in programming), when I would                         
        talk in my sleep it would be about things like being on the drum of the                         
        computer working some problem, having to wait for the drum to come                         
        around, etc.&nbsp; Symbolic execution is, in some sense, visualized                         
        as/via physical phenomena.&nbsp; It gave new meaning to me of                         
        expressions like &quot;spinning my wheels,&quot; &quot;running around in

        finding comfort working with abstractions (ahah: &quot;working&quot;,                         
        &quot;comfort&quot;), and others insisting that there be something real

        on Where Mathematics Comes From, and it will be interesting to                         
        see how much they go there.&nbsp; How abstractions (arithmetic and                         
        beyond) are passed around and handed down and acquired in each

        Tarbell and someone else before that.&nbsp; (I am thinking of the guy

        <small>I am looking at how to separate the different platform                         
        technologies for sampleWare, nfoWare tools, exercise, and so on.&nbsp;                         
        Java and .NET (Mono) provide a particular level that should be stable                         
        for 10 years or more, going forward.&nbsp; So these are useful ways to                         
        develop tools and present fundamental utilities, with the idea that they                         
        will be portable to whatever the future brings in terms of standard                         
        programming languages.&nbsp; The use of virtual machines also provides                         
        some important preservation qualities, it is to be supposed.&nbsp; At                         
        the same time, we need to look a that underlying platform, and the Intel                         
        PC is an obvious case.&nbsp; For that level we need console-mode                         
        applications and an understanding of the situation of that.&nbsp; The                         
        treatment of underlying platform is important for Situating (and                         
        debunking) Java anyhow.&nbsp; It would seem that the language is C and                         
        there is still the problem of situating C and C++.&nbsp; For console                         
        mode this isn't too bad and it is also non-trivial.&nbsp; Based on this                         
        musing, I don't think that is too bad.&nbsp; We will stay within Posix                         
        and the Standard C Library and see what we can do at that level.&nbsp;                         
        My thinking is to stay at CUA text-terminal mode at that level and                         
        simply not get into GUI at all.&nbsp; There can be something (not here)                         
        about why and when to use assembler or something equivalent to                         
        that.&nbsp; Until I looked at the bootstrap problem, I didn't think I                         
        would need to look at GNU/Linux, but I may.&nbsp; At least the                         
        console-mode tools should be compilable to work either way: GNU/Linux                         
        and MS-DOS, Win32 console modes in most cases.&nbsp; To get started, I                         
        simply need to qualify everything in terms of libraries that have been                         
        confirmed and application builds that have been carried out and

        the basic ground-up structure of a PC is, not because it is the only

        things, labels as metadata, and so on.&nbsp; I definitely do not want to                         
        be immersed in this before being able to start <i>Situating XML</i>, but                         
        it is going to come up.&nbsp; I was thinking about the relational model                         
        and the idea of an acceptable minimum of base relations from which all                         
        other relationships are derivable by turning a kind of crank.&nbsp; This                         
        is related to certain ideas of completeness, as in &quot;computational                         
        completeness,&quot; and that is worth looking at.&nbsp; Also, the                         
        temporal aspect that Codd and friends have worked on lately is worth                         
        looking at to see if it provides something that fits ideas of                         
        collaboratories, content management, versioning of material, and also                         
        change over time.&nbsp; There is a way of looking at this as pertaining                         
        to conceptual integrity, so conceptual models need to be appreciated                         
        too.</small>

        data, the results, etc., as the Jackson Structured Design method
