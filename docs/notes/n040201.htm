<font size="-1">           
  <p align="left">I have this interesting problem with regard to material that I    
  employ from e-mail notes, news groups, and web sites.&nbsp; Even when I have a    
  way of citing the material and its source, I don't have any way to assure    
  access to the original.&nbsp; Yet the original is an ephemeral thing that may    
  be altered, moved, or destroyed.&nbsp; How do I work something like a chain of    
  custody and evidence for material that I rely on, want to credit and cite, and    
  that is not mine to publish?</p>                   
  <p align="left">In the context of preserving the work so that someone could 
  verify it, review it, and perpetuate it in my absence -- maybe long after my 
  absence, there is the question of where do I put my confirming materials, and 
  how to I assert their provenance?</p>                
  <p align="left">My intention is to use web sites.&nbsp; That certainly makes    
  sense for <b><i>nfoWare</i></b>, where confirmable experience is a theme.&nbsp;    
  On the other hand, I can't have copies of source materials just lying    
  around.&nbsp; They need to be in a form where someone could access them and    
  confirm my use of them and also have it as a source without my basically    
  publishing the material on the web.</p>                   
  <p align="left">I ran into the down side of this when Karen Anderson's mother    
  wanted to know what the mention of her on my web site was all about.&nbsp;    
  That was because I had filed an e-mail of hers as a backup to a discussion,    
  and search engines found it.</p>                   
  <p align="left">I want one that remains a good backup, but that search engines    
  won't find, and the merely curious will not access meaningfully.&nbsp;</p>                   
  <p align="left">I have a similar problem on the <a href="http://odma.info/">ODMA    
  site</a>, because I keep e-mail notes that back up bug reports, discussions    
  for improvements, and so on.&nbsp; I want to preserve those, and it works best    
  to do so on the site itself, linked from the material that relies on those    
  contributions.&nbsp; But in some cases, it might be awkward to leave the note    
  in plain site.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>                   
  <p align="left">I have thought of a solution and a practice.&nbsp; It's    
  structure is as follows:</p>                   
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="left">The material is encrypted using a private key of    
      mine.&nbsp; This makes it unlikely to be useful to a search engine, but it    
      is clear that I did it and that anyone can confirm my use of it and what I    
      say about it by decrypting it with my public key.</li>   
    <li>
      <p align="left">Because I may need to assert some things about the 
      provenance of the material, I will also digitally sign, with my 
      certificate attached (or easily locatable) my identification of the 
      material, its source, and how it was encrypted.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">This effectively creates a separate signature of the    
      material, in a signed object.&nbsp; I need to think this through, but    
      that's the basic idea.</li>   
    <li>
      <p align="left">[dh:2004-02-20] This use of signed detached signatures   
      could be tied into my bibliographic entries.&nbsp; That has me thinking   
      about my bibliographic database versus bibliographic pages.&nbsp; There   
      should be a way to mark availability of archival materials in my   
      collection of source content, either way.</li>  
  </ul>
  <p align="left">I will try this out with some specifications that I have    
  obtained from the web.&nbsp; There is no need to encrypt the material when    
  there is permission to use it, but in cases when there is not, I will apply    
  this device.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>   
  <p align="left">[dh:2004-02-20] This thinking first came up when I had found   
  the Microsoft-IBM Technical Note on WS-Inspection, and that I noticed it was   
  becoming difficult to find on msdn.microsoft.com, there being no links to it   
  on the XML and Web Services pages there and I could only find it through   
  search by knowing exactly what to ask for.&nbsp; It may be permitted to repost   
  this particular document -- I will have to see what it says, but the thinking   
  not wanting to lose it inspired in me brought me to these ideas that I can   
  apply elsewhere.&nbsp; This doesn't deal with having my sites and materials   
  outlive me, so that is something to take up separately.</p>  
  <p align="left">[dh:2004-02-23] I found another reason for scooping  
  material.&nbsp; I began working with network capture utilities and drivers  
  that allow me to monitor LAN and Internet activities of my computer.&nbsp;  
  This is partly in response to work in my Computer Communications course, and  
  also because I do want to be able to monitor activities and understand how my  
  computers (and the software that I use) are playing on the network.&nbsp;  
  However, the sites that I downloaded my software from disappeared over the  
  past weekend.&nbsp; They are back now, but it reminded me that there are other  
  reasons for capturing what I did, what I found, and being able to duplicate it  
  even if the source disappears.&nbsp; So I need to work on this more, quickly.</p>
