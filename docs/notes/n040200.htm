</h1>       
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">By confirmable experience I mean arranging or recording an    
  activity in a way where it can be confirmed: what is done and what    
  happens.&nbsp; There is an aspect of repeatability.&nbsp; And of providing an    
  account from which one can replicate the experience.&nbsp; I may not be using    
  experience in a precise way, but I do mean to imply that someone else can    
  &quot;get it.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>          
  <p align="left">This means to me that we are talking about confirmable    
  behaviors.&nbsp; In computing and the use of information systems, it has there    
  be confirmable behavior that you can replicate yourself and describe in a way    
  that another can replicate it.&nbsp; This applies to trouble-shooting and it 
  applies to learning the ins-and-outs of some computer-mediated activity.</p>         
  <p align="left">I want this principle to be so strongly in place that when    
  something happens that is not confirmable, there is clearly something    
  amiss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like when your checkbook doesn't balance, only maybe 
  better.</p>       
  <p align="left">I also extend the idea of confirmable experience to the    
  metaphors and models that people invent about the systems they are using and    
  participating in.&nbsp; I want there to be strong support for their creating a    
  theory or story that is confirmable and that when it isn't, they can see what    
  is needed to have a story that is more compatible with the defined behavior of    
  the system.</p>          
  <p align="left">It is in this regard, the part about conceptual models and our 
  relationship to the computer-mediated process that I thought of as 
  &quot;experience.&quot;&nbsp; I am reminded that this may be an inappropriate 
  choice, because we cannot cause an experience -- the experiences that people 
  have are theirs, and they might best be thought of as internal and 
  inexplicable for an on-looker.&nbsp; Still, artifacts are regarded 
  evocatively, and we want to be responsible for that in ways that are available 
  and effective.&nbsp; This is an area to be dug into a bit more, although I 
  don't feel very expert about the cognitive-science side of this.</p>         
  <p align="left">I have moved quickly through some ideas and not nailed them    
  down very well.&nbsp; It is the purpose of this note to provide more concrete    
  expression of confirmable experience.</p>          
  <p align="left">Here's what I mean by confirmable behavior:</p>       
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p align="left">Everything that occurs is amenable to  
      confirmation: direct demonstration, including operation of any software or  
      computer-mediated exercise.</li> 
    <li>
      <p align="left">The construction, composition, and operation of 
      experiments and software implementations can be fully verified and 
      confirmed.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">There is always a way to trouble-shoot an experience and 
      determine failure points and root causes.</li>
    <li>
      <p align="left">The reader/user/student is not subjected to inscrutable      
      behavior and always has available the necessary resources for uncovering 
      an account of what transpired</li>    
    <li>
      <p align="left">There is guidance and suggestion for creation of 
      interpretations of the confirmable behavior that empower the users of the 
      system in making successful use of it.</li>    
  </ul>

<h1 align="left">2. <a name="Examples">Examples</a></h1>           
<blockquote>
<p align="left">To separate it from incoherence, there are examples with regard    
to toolcraft for communication between computer systems and computer    
networking.&nbsp; Just being able to observe and confirm network access, conduct    
of protocols, and exhibition of protocol data units would be a big help.&nbsp; I    
will pick my examples from there.</p>              
<p align="left">I will also pick one from incoherence, involving e-mail and how 
one describes to someone what one is seeing that is not being seen by someone in 
a remote place.</p>           
<p align="left">I will probably move these into separate notes or sets of notes, 
but they should work for us here.</p>           
</blockquote>
<h1 align="left">3. <a name="Context">Context</a></h1>          
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">The relationship to coherence.</p>
  <p align="left">The relationship to commercial arrangements, trust, and 
  trustworthy systems.</p>
  <p align="left">The relationship to scholarship and accountability.</p>
  <p align="left">Demonstration as a powerful element in the integrity of an 
  arrangement</p>
  <p align="left">I was taking the expression a part a little bit.&nbsp; That    
  is, an experience is what it is, and someone has it. To say that it be    
  confirmable is an odd use of language.&nbsp; There experience is what it is,    
  and pretty much the only access we have to what it was is through what we are    
  told about it by someone who claims having it.&nbsp; So what does it mean to    
  say we want to create or cause confirmable experiences?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>   
  <p align="left">It is mostly in the communication of breakdowns or    
  discrepancies and their resolution.&nbsp; It is in the    
  demonstration/repetition of observed behavior.&nbsp; It might even include an    
  account of an experience.</p>   
  <p align="left">The phrase &quot;confirmable experience&quot; is one that I    
  have become comfortable with. That does not mean it is a very good    
  choice.&nbsp; Only that I am comfortable with it.&nbsp; I must dig deeper    
  here.</p>
  <p align="left">Many examples have to do with the effort involved in 
  communicating something and how one learns from the other party that the 
  communication was unsuccessful for them, and what the breakdown was so that 
  the originator can at least be aware of that and also, perhaps, establish a 
  remedy that accomplishes the intended communication.</p>
  <p align="left">Use the breakdown around Bill sending me his document on    
  measures as an example.&nbsp; It and its resolution is a clear example of    
  wanting to accomplish a communication and it shows how we worked it out.</p>   
  <p align="left">The work that Bill and I are doing around coming up with a    
  simple example, based on digital signatures and signing of code is important    
  in another respect.&nbsp; Here we are out to establish a    
  confirmable-experience approach to the topic&nbsp; And have it work for us and    
  others at the same time.&nbsp; This one is about coherence as well as    
  confirmable experience and demonstration.</p>

<h1 align="left">4. <a name="Measures">Measures</a></h1>
          
<blockquote>
  <p align="left">Bill Anderson has provided me with some material using a Tom    
  Gilb requirements table.&nbsp; This is toward identification of measures for    
  confirmable experience.&nbsp; This will be a separate collaborative note, and    
  the activity is going to spawn some other questions about providing Wiki-ness    
  for <b><i>nfoWare</i></b> collaborations and discussions.</p>
