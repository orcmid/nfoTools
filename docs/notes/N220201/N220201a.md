Perhaps one of the most distinctive tacit arrangements by experienced users
of Windows PCs is the setup of their desktop display.  I am no different.  And
my approach has been continued and refined for over 40 years.  Even if I use
only a fragment in an illustrative screen capture, there is far too much that
may be unfamiliar to my intended audience.

## This Desktop is Not Yours

Presentation of my Windows 10 Desktop is unlikely to be familiar to many
novice users.  The clutter and the existing materials might not provide any
common familiarity.  I am so accustomed to this desktop arrangement, quite
attached to it, that I failed to see how it might be more confusing than
informative when I want to describe, for example, the creation of a shortcut
for initiation of a command-line session.

I'm also attached to the size of this desktop, providing 2560 x 1600 pixels
on a 30" monitor.  Showing it all creates a problem for anyone else to view
and discern details though, a common failing of screen captures.  In
particular, if I used this in a tutorial, or a problem report, the observer
may have no means to recognize an important detail.

I don't want to give up my PC Desktop in order to create
materials and examples for novices.  I need a better solution.
