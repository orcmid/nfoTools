I was stunned to find how much I had failed to bring a
[beginner mind](../N210901/) to [tools](../../tools/) narratives
intended for beginners and novices.  This folio is a cataloguing of those
failings and remediations for them.

My commitment is to provide on-ramps and guard rails; I must bring
execution on that to the forefront.  The progression is irregular.  At
the same time, I am making and using [nfoTools](../../) for my own
software-development purposes.

## The Beginner Mind Perspective

My beginner mind puts me in the place of someone
who is seeing a presentation for the first time; it is unfamiliar to that
mind.  In that way, I can assess how much is missing or in the way and must
be remedied, along with cues and links to deeper understanding.  In
particular, the beginner mind will unconceal tacit
understanding that a newcomer will not have.  Such repairs
can also be helpful to those who have expertise but might not have noticed
some aspect before.

I use beginner mind in auditing courses and materials that I am interested in
recommending to others.  In some cases, I will find a presentation too
problematic to recommend without some caveats by way of hazard warnings.

The beginner mind is also valuable in attempting and reporting confirmable
experiences.  It is also valuable in assessing every issue or complaint as
a contribution to eliciting the actual difficulty and improving a product and
its support.

## My Own Failures

Although I play "beginner mind" is assessing materials of others, I have been
negligent in providing that attitude to materials I am providing.  I rely
on unsaid assumptions that are latent in my choice of examples and screen
captures.  This set of notes is intended to recognize and remedy those
oversights.

## Combination with Progressive Disclosure

I am also committed to providing progressive disclosure, a means by which the
more-expert can assess what a topic is about and choose to drill down or not
as they find useful.  This is also intended to support those novices who
return to review a topic more deeply.

This requires smooth balance and will probably require many adjustments of
the work-in-progress [nfoTools](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools) materials.
