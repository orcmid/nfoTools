# ***N220201:** Beginner Mind Failures*

I was stunned to find how much I had failed to bring a
[beginner mind](../N210903/) to [tools](../../tools/) introductions
intended for beginners and novices.  This folio is a cataloguing of those
failings and remediations for them.

My commitment is to provide on-ramps and guard rails; I must bring
execution on that to the forefront.  The progression is irregular.  At
the same time, I am making and using [nfoTools](../../) for my own
software-development purposes.

## The Beginner Mind Perspective

My beginner mind puts me in the place of someone
who is seeing what I present for the first time; it is unfamiliar to that
mind.  In that way, I can assess how much I am putting in the way and must
simplify, along with cues and links to deeper understanding.  These may also
be helpful to those who have expertise but might not have noticed some aspect
before.  In particular, the beginner mind will unconceal tacit understanding
that a newcomer will not have.

The beginner mind is also valuable in attempting and reporting confirmable
experiences.

I also use beginner mind in auditing courses and materials that I am
interested in
recommending to others.  In some cases, I will find a presentation too
problematic to recommend without some caveats by way of hazard warnings.

## Combination with Progressive Disclosure

I am also committed to providing progressive disclosure, a means by which the
more-expert can assess what a topic is about and choose to drill down or not
as they find useful.  This is also intended to support those novices who
return to review a topic more deeply.

This requires smooth balance and will probably require many adjustments of
the work-in-progress here.
