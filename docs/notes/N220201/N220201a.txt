                       N220201a: NOT YOUR DESKTOP
                      ---------------------------

    I was stunned to find how much I had failed to bring a beginner mind to
    some of my tools introductions intended for beginners and novices.  This
    folio is a cataloguing of those and remediations for them.

    My commitment is to provide on-ramps and guard rails and I need to bring
    execution on that to the forefront.  The progression is irregular.  At
    the same time, I am making and using nfoTools for my own purposes.

TODO

 * Demonstrate my desktop and consider alternatives - create an account just
   for this and use the default desktop, if there is one.

 * Consider alternative desktops also, that is one that can be switched
   between.

 * Indicating how to do effective screen captures is a skill to go along with
   confirmable experiences and also mastering the PC (but should really focus
   on Windows 11 for that to have any enduring value)

 * Incorporate references on screen capturing as a skill, and on confirmable
   experience.

 * Illustrate the problem of captures that lose context and learning to
   remedy that.

 * There's an edit-like editor that is recommended by a programming-language
   text.  Maybe I can find that one and see if that is of any value here or
   in a treatment on text editors.  It's gedit and it is now quite a bit more
   elaborate than edit.com.  I will forego this and rely on notepad in early
   introduction to text editing.

 * Add N210901 Tacit Knowledge and the Beginner Mind to the related material

 * I am having great difficulty propogating version numbers and dates among
   the levels of folios.  I did not do that in my past use of folios, and I
   need to curtail this somehow.  It was easier before and I have to figure
   out how/why that was.

 * Links on the Xerox workstations would also be handy.  I might even refer to
   "Fumbling the Future."
