# ***nfoTools** Project Notes*

![Hard Hat Area](../images/hardhat-logo.gif)

***nfoTools*** [notes](.) are on topics that are not so specific
as [developments](../dev), [tools](../tools), and
[skills](../skills).  The pattern of chronological cataloguing is the
same as for the other three, using
N-prefixed folios/pages.

I invite discussion about this topic in the
[Discussion section](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/discussions).
Improvements and removal of defects in this particular documentation can be
reported and addressed in the
[Issues section](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/issues).  There are also
relevant [projects](https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/projects) from time to
time.
