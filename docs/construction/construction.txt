               NFOTOOLS DOCUMENTATION CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL
               --------------------------------------------

    The Construction Material portion of nfoTools documentation provides a
    collection of tools and techniques by which orcmid.github.io/nfoTools and
    its subwebs are maintained and operated.  It is part of the scaffolding
    used for the documentation and, to a lesser degree, organization of
    development materials as well.

TODO

 * Replicate a good model of construction structure and material for
   adoption here.

 * Migrate materials here so that downloads can be obtained from here and
   information about and in them point to nfoTools instead of nfoware.com.

 * This will come with clean-up of devKits in the orcmid/nfoTools repositiory.

 * Create index.md placeholder for subsequent expansion as some existing
   construction materials and notes are migrated from sites being deprecated.

 * Bring over the ClustrMap designated for https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools,
   having it at https://orcmid.github.io only if I can't avoid that.

 * Setup single templates for the folio cases that apply in the GitHub-
   hosted case.

 * Stick with the default rendering until I can't stand it.

 * Create experiments for the various layout challenges using the folios
   here.

 * Use the dev/ statement of Discussion ... on all other Markdown including
   here.

 * Use the T060501d heading bar setup on all markdown pages other than the
   front porch.

 * Populate a construction catalog, maybe looking to docEng for more.
