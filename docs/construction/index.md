# ***nfoTools** Documentation Construction Material*

![Hard Hat Area](../images/hardhat-logo.gif)

This Construction Material portion of  nfoTools/docs/ provides a record of the tools and techniques by which nfoTools/docs/ and its subwebs are maintained
and operated.

The Construction Material section has a
[construction structure](construction.txt) and a top-level construction zone.  There's management of the documentation's construction and and also
caffolding for the Construction Material itself.
