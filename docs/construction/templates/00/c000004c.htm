<!-- This page is used by FrontPage "Include Page" components on construction-material pages of this 
     site.  There is nothing in the body but what we want included.  For the present 
     page, the body contains an image href to be placed in the left cell of the Construction Block on 
     the pages.  This image will then appear exactly the way we want.  Editing of the image 
     is not done in the pages that include the component.  Instead, the image is edited on this page
     and the changes will be automatically propogated to all other pages that include this page.
     The present version always leads to the index.htm page of a section.
