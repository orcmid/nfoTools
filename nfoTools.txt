            USEFUL TOOLS IN DEVELOPMENT OF NFOWARE/NFOWORKS PROJECTS

                NFOTOOLS: SOURCE CODE VERSION CONTROL REPOSITORY
                ------------------------------------------------

    nfoTools is a collection of utilities and software components.  The
    tools are designed for use in composition of larger software projects
    for information-processing applications (and games of course).  nfoTools
    can apply anywhere in the complete learning-and-improvement lifecycle of
    software projects.

    nfoTools includes a Toolcraft on-ramp that supports beginners who want
    to understand more about programming and the tacit understanding of
    experienced software developers.  Crawl first, then walk, then run.
    Progressive discloser is used in a way that allows more-experienced
    visitors to quickly skip over details they already know.  Review of the
    basics may be useful though.

    Emphasis is on development of software for Microsoft Windows and using
    Microsoft Windows desktop tools as instruments of such efforts.  Only
    freely-available tools are required in addition to a Windows PC or laptop.
    The working language is English. This is how the author is equipped.

    While nfoTools are useful independently, they are chosen and developed
    first in service of specific software efforts originally housed on
    nfoWare.com, nfoWorks.org, and more-recent efforts now on GitHub.

TODO

  * Cover toolcraft and the intention of relying exclusively on freely-
    available software tools and libraries.

  * Explain the licensing approach and handling of open-source code and any
    contributions to it.

  * Add attribution boilerplates.

  * Use correct permalinks into master/default/main branch.

  * Address beginner mind.  Cover in docs or wiki here.  I need a way to
    rely on this from other projects that beginners and hobbyists may take
    interest in.

  * Address process and social matters too: GitHub and Discord, for example.

  * Also address or recognize learning approaches and available guildance
    as well: Udemy, Coursera, etc.

  * Mutate to precise construction structure compatible with usage of docs/.

  * Add on-ramp rerequisites and summaries/tutorials on file explorer, adding
    git and GitHub support, downloading and installing software, zip usage,
    editing with Visual Studio Code, installing Visual Studio build tools,
    console operation (cmd.exe), and creating C/C++ software projects.

  * Consider a folio structure similar to that of nfoWare & nfoWorks.  Explain
    what those are/were.

  * The raysan5/raylib-game-template is inspiration for use on rayLab and
    also nfoTools.  I need to find out if multiple templates are possible and
    having that work with a variety of rayLab and nfoTools cases.

  * I have been observing line-widths here, to keep text lines easily
    printable, but I've dropped using ruler lines.  Put that back in.
