TODO
  * Add deployment-oriented organization that will be used in releasing beta
    and later versions of the Adv10 transposition.
  * Confirm compile VS 2015 Community from the repro without fussing about
    much.  Will structure later.
  * Provide access to the web folios for Adv10 and the Cavern project.
  * Add GitHub Readme when I am ready.
  * Add further attribution information about derivation of this project's
    code from advent.w, explaining the value of that for study and also
    how this code relates to but is no substitute for advent.w.
  * Produce a null implementation that basically provides a startup and exit,
    and initial deployment structure.
  * Report the opening, and the various notifications, to Don Knuth and Don
    Woods for their review and confirmation that their reservations are
    satisfied.
  * Set up command-line options for the adv10 executable too.  At least the
    unknown parameters, which is what "-?" will also always produce.
  * Tuck the permission mails and other hard copy materials into a paper
    file folder.
  * Create a sequestered web-site folder for preserving copies of the source
    materials that I am basing this project on.
  * Deal with dependencies and the intermediate use of libraries under Adv10.
  * Cover toolcraft and the intention of relying exclusively on freely-
    available software tools and libraries.
  * Explain the licensing approach and handling of open-source code and any
    contributions to it.
