                     --------------------------------------

    nfoTools is a collection of utilities and software components.  The
    tools are designed for in the composition of larger software projects
    for information-processing applications.  They can apply anywhere in
    the complete learning-and-improvement lifecycle of software projects.
    
    While nfoTools are useful independently, they are chosen and developed
    in service of specific nfoWare.com and nfoWorks.org software efforts.

TODO
  * Work down through devKits/ to the first components being transposed here.
  * Add GitHub Readme.md when I ready.
  * Cover toolcraft and the intention of relying exclusively on freely-
    available software tools and libraries.
  * Explain the licensing approach and handling of open-source code and any
    contributions to it.
