            USEFUL TOOLS IN DEVELOPMENT OF NFOWARE/NFOWORKS PROJECTS

                     SOURCE CODE VERSION CONTROL REPOSITORY
                     --------------------------------------

    nfoTools is a collection of utilities and software components.  The
    tools are designed for use as utilities and support for  composition of
    larger software projects for information-processing applications.  They
    can apply anywhere in the complete learning-and-improvement lifecycle of
    software projects.

    Emphasis is on development of software for Microsoft Windows and using
    Microsoft Windows desktop tools as instruments of such efforts.

    While nfoTools are useful independently, they are chosen and developed
    in service of specific nfoWare.com and nfoWorks.org software efforts.

TODO

  * Cover toolcraft and the intention of relying exclusively on freely-
    available software tools and libraries.

  * Explain the licensing approach and handling of open-source code and any
    contributions to it.

  * Add attribution boilerplates.

  * Use correct permalinks into master/default branch.

  * Address beginner mind matters.  This needs either docs or wiki here.
    I need a way to rely on this from other projects that beginners and
    hobbyists may take an interest in.

  * Address process and social matters too: GitHub and Discord, for example.

  * Also address or recognize learning approaches and available guildance
    as well: Udemy, Coursera, etc.

  * Mutate to precise construction structure compatible with usage of docs/.

  * Add on-ramp rerequisites and summaries/tutorials on file explorer, adding
    git and GitHub support, downloading and installing software, zip usage,
    editing with Visual Studio Code, installing Visual Studio build tools,
    console operation (cmd.exe), and creating C/C++ software projects.
