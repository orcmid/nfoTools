                      ADV10 DEVELOPER CONSTRUCTION SETS
                      =================================

    Developer construction sets are platform-specific structures for 
    compiling and exercising the Adv10 software.  
    
    In this approach, the code is always compilable and executable as
    we work through the 0.*.* semantic versions.  There should always be
    tests as well.  When there are version releases, the construction set
    will build the developer version of that release.
    
    It is intended that developer versions avoid provide branding of any
    kind.  That also means deployment does not include the essential steps
    for branding and delivery via app stores and other means for authenti-
    cated end-user versions.  
    
    The purpose of this division is to avoid counterfeiting and creation of
    imposter versions of software intended for casual users.  Each provider
    of authenticated and verificable deployments must provide their own
    secure authentication along with any appropriate branding.
    
    The main thrust is development on and for the Microsoft Windows platform.
    Other platforms and construction cases will be entertained. The primary
    effort for Windows is addressed to the largest international community
    of users and (potential) developers.  This is for practical purposes as
    well as a means of exploiting and demonstrating the rich support for
    high-functioning applications.
    
    
MANIFEST

    dev.txt
        This description file on organization of the archive and use of its
        materials.
        
    WinCon/
        Construction set for Windows Console version of Adv10.  Construction
        employs freely-available Microsoft development tools for construction
        on the Microsoft Windows PC platform.
        
    VCbinder/ (provisional)
        code for development of the redistributable VCbinder.zip
        construction-set snippet.  This is provisional development as
        a companion within Adv10 until a stable VCbinder.zip is
        available as a separately-available construction-set element.

TODO

 * Work up the Visual C++ console compilation case, WinCon
 
 * Add something about finding how to build particular construction sets.
   It can be appropriate pointers.
 
 * Add something about developing/maintaining construction sets.
   This can be by appropriate pointers.
 
 * Get to the first level of clean compilation for an executable null 
   implementation, and work a form of test-driven spiral development.

 0.0.3 2016-10-26-11:25 Move the provisional VCbinder/ development to
       this level, for experimental use within WinCon/
 0.0.2 2016-10-24-08:02 Light editing, motivation for Windows emphasis.
 0.0.1 2016-10-22-11:12 Introduce the WinCon/ construction set.
       The limitation to unbranded dev builds is also emphasized.
 0.0.0 2016-10-15-13:12 Initial Placeholder as part of folder setup.
