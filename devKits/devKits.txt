                     DEVKITS CONSTRUCTION KITS AND HELPERS
                     =====================================

    Developer construction sets are platform-specific structures for
    compiling and exercising the Adv10 software.

    In this approach, the code is always compilable and executable as
    we work through the 0.*.* semantic versions.  There should always be
    tests as well.  When there are version releases, the construction set
    will build the developer version of that release.

    It is intended that developer versions avoid branding of any kind.
    That also means deployment does not include the essential steps
    for branding and delivery via app stores and other means for authenti-
    cated end-user versions.

    The purpose of this division is to avoid counterfeiting and creation of
    imposter versions of software intended for casual users.  Each provider
    of authenticated and verificable deployments must provide their own
    secure authentication along with any appropriate branding.

    The main thrust is development on and for the Microsoft Windows platform.
    Other platforms and construction cases will be entertained. The primary
    effort for Windows is addressed to the largest international community
    of users and (potential) developers.  This is for practical purposes as
    well as a means of exploiting and demonstrating the rich support for
    high-functioning applications.

TODO

 * We need prerequisites, general ones -- GitHub, etc.

 * We need prerequisites for building at a particular Dev level.

 * We need links for tooling and for training, tutorials, etc.  Cybersmithing.

 * Some of the safeguards can be part of development patterns and not featured
   so strongly on this page.  Move more to what is interesting for users and
   the curious.

 * Make us of docs and maybe wiki here also, with help from docEng.

 * The scaffolding/skeleton scheme used here is a thing also, but maybe not
   to go overboard with it.
