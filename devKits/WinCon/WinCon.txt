                    ADV10 WINDOWS CONSOLE CONSTRUCTION SET
                    ======================================

    This construction set employs Microsoft Windows tools to construct
    a command-line console version of Adv10.  This form of the software
    is the closest to the original Collosal Cave Adventure when it 
    ran as a terminal application.
    
PREREQUISITES

    [TBD]
    
DEPENDENCIES

  * Visual C command-line compiler, cl.exe, and its libraries for building
    standard C/C++ on a Microsoft Windows PC.
    
    It is sufficient to obtain and install a free version of Microsoft Visual
    Studio or Microsoft Visual C.  Versions this WinCon has been tested with
    include
    
     - Visual Studio Community 2015 with Update 3 (14.0 C++ features)
     - Visual Studio Express 2015 for Windows Desktop (14.0 C++ features)
     - Visual C++ Build Tools 2015 Update 3 (14.0)
     - Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop Update 5 
       (12.0 C++ features)
     - Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows Desktop (11.0 C++ features)
    Probably Obsolete and no longer available for download: 
     - Visual Studio 2010 Express (10.0 C++ features, via Studio 2010 SP1 ?)
     - Visual Studio Express 2008 (9.0)
     - Visual C++ Express 2005 (8.0)
    
BUILDING AND RUNNING THE WINCON ADV10

    [TBD]

DEPLOYING AND OPERATING THE WINCON ADV10

    [TBD]
    
WORKING ON THE WINCON ADV10 SOURCE CODE

    [TBD]
    
   
MANIFEST

    .gitignore (from VCbinder)
        Ignoring folders that are created only for construction activity
        and not intended as part of the maintained source tree.  This
        prevents local customizations of working material from infecting
        the shared public source-code tree.

    WinCon.txt
        This description file on organization of the construction set
        and use of its materials.
        
    VCbind.bat (from VCbinder)
        script for performing a VCbind operation using the extracted 
        VCbind.zip; the extraction is confirmed and then the VCbind.bat
        in the extracted material is performed.
        
    VCbind.txt (from VCbinder)
        manifest and instructions from VCbind.zip available for review
        before extracting VCbind.zip.
        
    VCbind.zip (from VCbinder)
        package which provides the working VC binding script when extracted
        to VCbind/ here.
        
    VCbinder.zip 
        package from which the integration of VCbind material is made.
        This is an external dependency that is carried here for independent
        completeness.

TODO
 
 * Work up the Visual C++ console compilation case.
 
 * Add VCbind/ and VCbuild/ for doing it all using the command line.
 
 * Add VCrun for running the result of a VCbuild (or VS/VC project?)
 
 * Add VSproject/ for doing all of this with Visual Studio.
 
 * Consider VScode for using Visual Code if we can get the workspace to
   work the way we need.  It does not appear that Visual Code compiles will
   work well with the code in a different place than where the build happens.
   There is also a problem with the code being in a different location than
   the workspace.  
 
 * Evaluate whether the CLang front end is an useful alternative.
 
 * Add prerequisities for the Windows Console build.
 
 * Add something about more information on constructing and verifying
   a build, and simply using the result to play the game.
 
 * Add anything about developing/maintaining the WinCon set.
   This can be by appropriate pointers.
 
 * Get to the first level of clean compilation for an executable null 
   implementation, and work a form of test-driven spiral development.
   This is going to be the model for similar conduct on other platforms.
   
 * Don't worry about polish.  Get WinCon to a point where builds can be
   started without fussing too much about the narrative and tutorial aspects
   at this point.  That can all be filled in later.
   
 * It is not clear whether and how Micosoft Visual Studio Team Services
   online is helpful here, especially for WinCon builds.  However, figuring
   out Release Management and integration with Visual Studio Code are all
   interesting cases.  <https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/>.
