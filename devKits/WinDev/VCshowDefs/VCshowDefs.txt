              VCshowDefs: SHOW PREPROCESSOR DEFINES IN VC/C++
              ===============================================

    A family of small C/C++ Language programs that demonstrate the values
    of preprocessor settings introduced-by/used-in various libraries,
    including the C Language Standard libraries and other libraries of
    interest.  These are useful for confirmation of settings and also for
    identifying what platform-specific settings might be in a particular
    compilation configuration.

    Further documentation and web pages for downloading of the various
    versions is at <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D230201/>.

        This description file on organization of the archive and use of its
        materials.

    VCshowDefs.c
        The archetypical showDefs file set up for verification of C/C++
        preprocessor definitions when using the Microsoft Buid Tools VC/C++
        compiler, CL.exe.

    VCshowDefsRun-2023-02-15T2046Z.txt
        Output of a console session in which VCshowDefs.c is compiled and
        the successfully-produced VCshowDefs.exe run to produce output related
        to defines found (and not found) with a simple C Language compilation
        using the identified version of VC/C++ for producing x64 programs.

TODO

 * Add showDefs to WinDev as a tool for development and also testing.  Even
   though it might work on other platforms, I don't intend to support it
   with compilers other than VC in Visual Studio Build Tools.

 * Distinguish specific instances from the archtypical template.  This may
   involve splitting apart the showDefs.c being transformed to VCshowDefs.c
   and other variations.

 * Cross-link to the example of a capture technique as used in VCrayApp 0.1.0.

 * Create a docs\dev\ for VCshowDefs, what the principle technique is, and
   what individual downloads there are.

 * Add .gitignore for eliminating *.obj and *.exe from the repository.
