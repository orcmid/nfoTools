                  VCRAYNEST: DEVKIT FOR SHARED RAYLIB VCRAYAPPS
                  =============================================

    The VCrayNest/ construction kit and helpers are for creation of
    construction sets that build sets of Windows raylib applications using
    Microsoft developer tools on Windows for Windows.

    This area is for the development, confirmation, and packaging of the
    VCrayNest devkit.  The public availability of distributions and their
    usage is treated under docs/dev <https://orcmid.google.io/nfoTools/dev/>
    topics.

TODO

  * Do not ignore the WinDev.txt considerations of configuration pollution and
   other measures to avoid contamination of a clone.  The treatment of
   dependencies also applies at the level of VCrayNest.

 * Use VCrayNest as the model and setup for a grouping of VCrayApp projects
   all using the same raylib/ but each having their own cache/, app/, src/
   etc., assuming VCrayApp is used.

 * The current VCrayNest model using VCrayApp template (included in the dist)
   Tends to have each fledgling with its own cache. Yes, that is the idea.

 * A good VCrayTest would provide for cycling through testcases and also
   reporting success.  Could run quiet or with away to select the test or
   example to demonstrate.  I am not certain this is about testing one's own
   rayApp or raySuite (what took me so long to identify that).  Can this be
   just a modification of VCrayNest for the specific purpose of testing a
   raylib development clone building.

 * One thing that cculd happen with VCrayTest is modification of examples
   to account for (anticipated) breaking changes and/or additions.

 * We're also looking at a development lifecycle case.  Need to take the
   VCrayNest scenarios and tutorials all the way to producing a distribution.
