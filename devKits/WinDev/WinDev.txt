                    WINDOWS CONSTRUCTION KITS AND HELPERS
                    =====================================

    The WinDev/ construction kits and helpers are for creation of construction
    sets that build Windows programs using Microsoft developer tools on Windows.    
     
MANIFEST

    WinDev.txt
        This description file on organization of the archive and use of its
        materials.
        
    VCbinder/
        Kit for introduction of VCbind as a helper in construction sets
        that produce Windows programs using the VC++ Build tools in a 
        Windows command shell session.
        
    WinConKit/
        Kit for construction sets that build C/C++ Windows Console applica-
        tions using Windows command shell sessions.

TODO

 * Adjust VCbinder/ for its new location
 
 * Transform the seed material from Adv10/dev/WinCon as the initial 
   skeleton for WinConKit/
   
 * There is some dependency management to be addressed here.  In particular
   the stable versions (and the branches that preserve them) need to be
   clearly separated from the in-progress working versions.  
   
 * The sources of a distribution should be in the same folder that has the
   binaries of the same distributions.  Implement that in VCbinder.
   
 * We need to look into dependencies when one is developing and what they
   might change to in a stable construction set.  I suppose the intriguing case
   is when one is building with a working version of a dependency in 
   anticipation and testing for its eventual deployment.  The target of 
   the dependency changes in taht case. This somehow needs to be sheltered
   away from how a deployed WinCon Construction Set is meant to work.  And
   also how and when it is updated for later/different versions of dependencies.
   There needs to be more thought on how we differentiate this as an SE4E
   consideration.  The use of canned .zip components for the stable bits is 
   valuable.  It is not the whole story.  PS: This is more of a devKIts
   discussion, but it will show up real quick here in WinDev.

       bundling with -dist versions.
