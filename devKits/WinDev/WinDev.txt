                    WINDOWS CONSTRUCTION KITS AND HELPERS
                    =====================================

    The WinDev/ construction kits and helpers are for creation of construction
    sets that build Windows programs using Microsoft developer tools on
    Windows.  There is focus on minimum tooling requirements, especially for
    reproducing the builds of various tools and straightforward apps.

MANIFEST

    WinDev.txt
        This description file on organization of the archive and use of its
        materials.

    VCbinder/
        Kit for introduction of VCbind as a helper in construction sets
        that produce Windows programs using the VC++ Build tools in a
        Windows command shell session.

    WinConKit/
        Kit for construction sets that build C/C++ Windows Console applica-
        tions using Windows command shell sessions.

TODO

 * Adjust VCbinder/ for its new location

 * Transform the seed material from Adv10/dev/WinCon as the initial
   skeleton for WinConKit/

 * There is some dependency management to be addressed here.  In particular
   the stable versions (and the branches that preserve them) need to be
   clearly separated from the in-progress working versions.

 * The sources of a distribution should be in the same folder that has the
   binaries of the same distributions.  Implement that in VCbinder.

 * We need to look into dependencies when one is developing and what they
   might change to in a stable construction set.  I suppose the intriguing
   case is when one is building with a working version of a dependency in
   anticipation and testing for its eventual deployment.  The target of
   the dependency changes in that case. This somehow needs to be sheltered
   away from how a deployed WinCon Construction Set is meant to work.  And
   also how and when it is updated for later/different versions of
   dependencies.  There needs to be more thought on how we differentiate this
   as an SE4E consideration.  The use of canned .zip components for the
   stable bits is valuable.  It is not the whole story.  PS: This is more of
   a devKIts discussion, but it will show up real quick here in WinDev.

 * DISCOVERABILITY ISSUES. The deployment of Visual Studio and of Microsoft
   Build Tools has changed in ways that defeat discovery of installed tools
   by VCbind.  The appearance of settings that cue location of build tools is
   no longer at the Windows session level.  To locate tools now, one must
   rely on Windows 10 Start page entries that may be difficult to discover.
   This means there must be some additional contortions by useres of the
   WinDev kits for desktop and probably other development cases.
