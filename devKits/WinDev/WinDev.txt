                    WINDOWS CONSTRUCTION KITS AND HELPERS
                    =====================================

    The WinDev/ construction kits and helpers are for creation of construction
    sets that build Windows programs using Microsoft developer tools on
    Windows.  There is focus on minimum tooling requirements, especially for
    reproducing the builds of various tools and straightforward apps.

MANIFEST

    WinDev.txt
        This description file on organization of the archive and use of its
        materials.

    VCbinder/
        Kit for introduction of VCbind as a helper in construction sets
        that produce Windows programs using Visual Studio Build Tools in a
        Windows command shell session.

    WinConKit/
        Kit for construction sets that build C/C++ Windows Console applica-
        tions using Windows command shell sessions. These include projects
        for command-line games and utilities as well as ones that provide
        simple graphical operation.

TODO

 * Adjust VCbinder/ for its new location

 * Update VCbinder to reflect the reality of Visual Studio Build Tools
   "discoverability" starting with VS 2017.

 * Update the WinConKit case so that a simple handling of configuration
   cases can work with a single workspace setup in Visual Studio Code.

 * Transform the seed material from Adv10/dev/WinCon as the initial
   skeleton for WinConKit/ if that is still needed.  This should have been
   down with a fork.

 * There is some dependency management to be addressed here.  In particular
   the stable versions (and the branches that preserve them) need to be
   clearly separated from the in-progress working versions.

 * The sources of a distribution should be in the same folder that has the
   binaries of the same distributions.  Implement that in VCbinder.  Remember
   what this item is about.

 * We need to look into dependencies when one is developing and what they
   might change to in a stable construction set.  I suppose the intriguing
   case is when one is building with a working version of a dependency in
   anticipation and testing for its eventual deployment.  The target of
   the dependency changes in that case. This somehow needs to be sheltered
   away from how a deployed WinCon Construction Set is meant to work.  And
   also how and when it is updated for later/different versions of
   dependencies.  There needs to be more thought on how we differentiate this
   as an SE4E consideration.  The use of canned .zip components for the
   stable bits is valuable.  It is not the whole story.  PS: This is more of
   a devKIts discussion, but it will show up real quick here in WinDev.

 * DISCOVERABILITY ISSUES. The deployment of Visual Studio and of Microsoft
   Build Tools has changed in ways that defeat discovery of installed tools
   by VCbind.  The appearance of settings that cue location of build tools is
   no longer at the command-line session level.  To locate tools now, users
   must rely on Windows-installed Command Prompts and operate inside those
   console-session initiations.  VCbind must be adusted to operate when any
   of those prompts have been established.  This also requires approaches to
   compilation from within developer tools such as Visual Studio Code and it
   being initiated from within such a console session.

 * COLLISION AVOIDANCE.  There are times when ephemeral materials and user-
   customizations are to be made in the use of a cloned kit-employing project.
   The areas where such materials are introduced are subject to .gitignore of
   the cloned project when they are internal to the cloned materials. Users
   must have a way to include those adaptations in git-managed projects of
   their own without impacting the cloned kit-employing project.  Thisalso
   means that the kit-employing project must have a clean way to deal with
   breaking changes that impact existing customization.  This needs to be
   handled in a manner that does not involve over-thinking the situation,
   while relying on straightforward (maybe tedious) procedures.
