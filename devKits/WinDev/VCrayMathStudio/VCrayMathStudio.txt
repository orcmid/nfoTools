                           RAYLIB MATH STUDY PROJECT
                           =========================

<https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/blob/master/devKits/WinDev/VCrayMathStudio/VCrayMathStudio.txt>

                STUDYING AN DEMONSTRATING THE USE OF RAYMATH
                --------------------------------------------

    This effort is also related to minilabs for T060101 C/C++ Programming,
    and some of the challenges will be comparison between the two for certain
    overlapping situations.

TODO

 * Need to check the soundness of EPSILON = .000001f and how does it compare
   with information in C Library definitions.  In <float.h> there are
   FLT_EPSILON, DBL_EPSILON, and LDBL_EPSILON.  There are also FLT_RADIX,
   FLT_MANT_DIG, DBL_MANT_DIG, and LDBL_MANT_DIG.  There are also MIN_EXP and
   MAX_EXP for all of them.

 * There are some odd rules about numbers of decimal digits.  It would seem
   that there are ways to check these to understand what is happening.

 * PI is not defined in math.h.

 * Check the raymath definition of PI and also RAD2DEG, DEG2RAD.

 * We also need to consider the special strings that are valuable in printf
   format strings.

 * I am unclear on having this under dev/ when it seems to be more under
   tools/ and, in particular, under docs/.

 * There is probably a connection to myCleanC here.  I need to work that out
   also.

 * One thing to work out has to do with use of rand() and the range-based
   raylib functions.  There needs to be some analysis of how to make ranges
   truly random, even though we are not looking at cryptographically-safe
   randomness.  These need to at least be understood about how they might be
   biased against perfectly-uniform distribution of results.

 * We need a way to stop the hand-waving about float/double precisions not
   mattering with regard to sufficient precision and introduce understanding
   of how to know when it does matter and how to recognized that.
