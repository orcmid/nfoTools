                             VCBIND.ZIP CONSTRUCTION
                             =======================

        NOTE: Extensive details are provided here and in VCbind.zip to
        support non-expert testing and confirmation of VCbind operation.
        Novices without the experience to have developed VCbind themselves
        should be able (1) to use VCbind, (2) to confirm its functioning,
        and (3) to make adaptations/variations as more learned.

    The files and the VCbind.zip here are in-progress development versions.
    For the latest version considered stable for general use, check the
    sibling devBinder/ folder for how VCbinder is constructed and the version
    of VCbind.zip incorporated there.  For further information on VCbind,
    it's development, latest downloads, and the relationship to source-code
    construction sets, see <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161101b.htm>.

    The details of VCbind.zip and its usage are in the VCbind-*.txt file
    for the particular version (e.g., VCbind-0.1.1.txt).  That file is also
    in the VCbind.zip package.  It is common for the file to also appear
    alongside VCbind.zip in a construction set so that users (1) can determine
    how to proceed before extracting VCbind.zip content itself, (2) can
    identify the version of VCbind to determine its current status, and
    (3) can verify that the VCbind.zip is for the same version.

 A. USING VCBIND.ZIP

    The VCbind-*.txt file of a given VCbind.zip provides the instructions
    for its usage as part of a construction set.  That is the information
    to be honored along with any companion construction-set instructions.

    To obtain the VCbind currently recommended for new/updated construction
    sets, consult <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161101b.htm>.  Historical
    versions are also located there.

    For additional material and VCbind developer use check into VCbinder,
    <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161102.htm>.  VCbinder covers adding
    VCbind into your own construction sets that make command-line use of
    the VC++ compiler and related Microsoft development tools.


 B. DEPENDENCIES FOR VCBIND USAGE

    Beside built-in Microsoft Windows utilities, VCbind depends only on
    freely-available versions of Visual Studio software, whether Express or
    Community editions.

    There is no reliance on the Visual Studio IDE (Integrated Development
    Environment) itself, just the command-line compiler and development tools.
    Providing ways to make use of source-code editors and IDEs, even though
    building from the command line, are the subject of future VCbind and
    related materials.


 C. PREREQUISITES FOR VCBIND USAGE

    Have a text editor that is suitable for viewing/editing plsintext, batch
    scripts, source code, and compiler error logs.

    Be able to to use the Windows Command Shell, cmd.exe, in navigation of
    the file system and in operating batch-script (.bat) files.

    Be able to use the Windows File explorer to navigate file-system details
    and to use Zip (.zip) packages.

    The same dependencies apply to development work on VCbind itself.


 D. PREREQUISITE CAPABILITIES FOR VCBIND DEVELOPMENT WORK

    If you are inexperienced with use of the Windows command shell, of the
    Visual C/C++ compiler, and of related command-line tools, gain
    familiarization with operation of VCbind by using it in an existing
    construction set.  Practice construction sets that produces simple
    command-line programs from stable source-code releases.

    For greater skill, go through the testing and confirmation of VCbind.zip
    as provided in its distributions.

    Then inspect this devBind material.  Review and test the maintenance
    procedure, identifying questions that need to be resolved.  Determine
    capabilities to work on, if any.

    Going deeper may involve expanding skills in several areas.  The
    following checklist can be used to assess where study and experience
    may be needed.

     * Working with the source-code management system, if any, that this
       source code folder originates at, currently the GitHub project at
       <http://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools>. Learn to clone and/or fork
       this development.  Work on a branch as appropriate.

     * Performing console (cmd.exe) command-line sessions on Microsoft
       Windows

     * Editing of text and batch (.bat) files in a manner that preserves
       formatting and conventions for them

     * Experience with the built-in Compressed (zipped) Folder support of
       Microsoft Windows.  Optional use of alternative compression software
       in a manner that is compatible with the built-in provisions.

     * Demonstrating the testing and confirmation of VCbind.bat operation,
       including all of the exception cases

     * Using the Microsoft cl.exe command-line compiler in demonstration of
       successful VCbind accomplishment

     * Optionally creating shortcuts to batch files and customizing the
       console session's properties

     * Further understanding and using the command-line environment of
       Windows and how the Visual C++ components are found and operated on
       Windows


 E. DEVBIND EMHANCEMENT AND MAINTENANCE CODE-AND-TEST CYCLE

 1. Have this source code folder in a PC location where you can edit all
    of its content.  If the folder is not named devBind\, adjust what
    follows below accordingly.  It is recommended that you have a clone
    or fork of the origin repository in order to have source-code control
    of your changes, whether or not for contribution back to the origin
    project.

 2. In the devBind\ folder, follow the VCbind-*.txt instructions and
    extract VCbind.zip to the subfolder VCbind\ (i.e., Windows
    folder location devBind\VCbind\).

    The following steps have been employed in the original progression
    of devBind work.  There are many ways to accomplish the same result.
    The key is to always know what files are the latest and not risk
    using older versions by mistake.

 3. Edit the VCbind.bat and VCbind-*.txt files here in the devBind\
    folder.  Rename the VCbind-x.y.z.txt file to reflect the version being
    worked on.  Copy modified VCbind.bat files to devBind\VCbind\ for testing
    and confirmation of test cases.  Confirm that the cl.exe compiler can be
    operated and that successful compilations are produced.  The semantic
    versioning identifier presented by VCbind.bat and in the naming of
    VCbind-*.txt will depend on the purpose of your modifications.
    See <http://semver.org/>.

 4. Wnen your work is completed or at an intermediate check-point, synchronize
    VCbind.zip to have your changes.

    4.1 Update VCbind-x.y.z.txt and related documentation and testing
        material.

    4.2 Delete the devBind\VCbind.zip file.

    4.2 In the Windows File Explorer, creat a New Compressed (zipped) Folder
        in devBind\.  Name it VCbind.zip.

    4.3 Drag the all of the VCbind.zip-intended devBind\ files into the
        new, empty VCbind.zip, including LICENSE.txt, NOTICE.txt, VCbind.bat,
        and VCbind-x.y.z.txt.

 5. Adjust this devBind.txt to reflect any change to the manifest and
    anything else that needs to be changed to have current documentation.

 6. Check-in the modified/new materials under the source-code management
    you are using.  Depending on the state of completion and project
    requirements for thorough testing, contribute back to any project
    your work is being contributed to.

TODO

    In addition to these TODO items, the web-facing material on
    <http://nfoWare.com> has a Diary and Job Jar of VCbind items
    at <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161101a.htm>.

 * Provide links for resolving the dependencies.

 * Provide links for the prerequisites.  Also to examples of where VCbind
   is used in cases that are relatively easy to teeth on.

 * Test with Visual Studio C++ Express 2008.

 * Adjust :USAGE of VCbind.bat to satisfy :USAGE chaining when spliced by
   the caller.

 * Explain the [+] option better and use "splicing" in the description.

 * Get the :USAGE working properly in Adv10Build.bat.

 * Change :USAGE chaining from Adv10Run.bat through VCbind.bat so that
   it can be provided progressively.  This is needed because outer
   scripts should not know precise details of inner parameters even though
   the basic structure is understood.  Also, common outer parameters should
   not be repeated.

 * The convention for :USAGE chaining is as follows.  If embedded ("+"),
   do not repeat common information in the definitions.  Only describe
   the parameters that are acted on uniquelly by a given script.  When
   the next level is not available, just report the case that is defined
   lower, whether embedded or not.

 * Link to an illustrated procedure for the extraction from VCbind.zip.

 * Link to an illustrated procedure with regard to desired Windows desktop
   options for performing developer and trouble-shooting work.

 * Link to an illustrated procedure for the easiest way to fire up VCbind.bat.

 * Link to an illustrated procedure for firing up a command-shell session,
   navigating to VCbind\ or other place, performing a VCbind.bat operation,
   and use the resulting environment in the session.

 * Does a branch remain available even if it is merged back to master?

 * For the nfoWare.com d161101*-dist folders, there is more to do in
   identifying where to find supporting utilities (e.g., GPG and SHA256SUM),
   more about toolcraft with Git, and also more about [Tortoise]Git and use of
   Git command-line operations in addition to any GitHub reliance.

 * Put information about use of the source at the distribution description,
   (e.g., d161101c-dist/) leaving the release page (e.g., d161101c.htm) to
   focus on use of that VCbind, not on its download, testing, and maintenance.

 * The source discussion should emphasize that this is Code in the Open, and
   not an organized open-source project, despite the licensing.

 * There should be a place on more about the error messages that arise and
   what they mean?

 * Switch to thorough Semantic Versioning and accounting for pre-release
   versions of artifacts.

 * Make it clear that ARM is not supported, nor the Itaniums or whatever
   they were.
