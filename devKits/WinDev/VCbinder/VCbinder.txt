          CREATE VCBINDER FOR VISUAL C/C++ COMMAND-LINE DEVELOPMENT
          =========================================================
                  
          
    VCbinder.zip is a package from which a development project can install
    a VCbind.zip and a couple of collateral files.  The extraction is for
    common elements of construction sets in the source code of software 
    projects.  The VCbinder elements are useful in using Windows console
    sessions for building a Windows applications on Microsoft Windows.  It is
    not necessary to redistribute VCbinder.zip within a construction set,
    although it may be convenient to do so.
    
    VCbind.zip, extracted from VCbinder.zip, is redistributed in the source
    code of construction sets.  Recipients of the construction extract that
    VCbind.zip to provide a working folder and helper script, VCbind.bat.
    
    The extracted VCbind.bat allows console session-development without
    depending on the Visual Studio (or any other) Integrated Development
    Environment (IDE), even though the tools are commonly installed as
    part of freely-available versions of Visual Studio.

TODO

 * It would be interesting to have a make process for making VCbinder.zip.
 
 * Verify the structure with cmd.exe, PowerShell, TC, and MSYS2 (POSIX)
   shells and possibly CYGWIN.  It is desirable that these batch scripts work
   from underneath all of those shells.  Any usability with Linux on Windows
   needs to be investigated.

 * Add prerequisites, with links to more on satisfying the prerequisites.

 * There needs to be a location (nfoWare/devtools, likely) where illustrated
   use is provided, and the latest version can be obtained independent of the
   project that redistributes a VCbind.zip.

 * Create VCbind.bat in a way that is usable from sibling folders.  This must
   cope with the absence of a full path for the location of the source tree
   that contains a VCbind-using construction set.
   
 * There seems to be no reason to include the development source in the
   VCbind.zip itself.  Include information on location of the source code.
    
 * VCbind.zip needs to provide information on how to deploy VCbind.zip for
   anyone to incorporate it.  This might link to the maintained source, and
   it should also be complete enough for free-standing redistribution.
   
 * Companion material that should be redistributable at the level of 
   VCbind.zip is provided along with VCbind.zip in VCbinder.zip. One thing
   that must be added by the user is any .gitignore for VCbind/ or the
   equivalent, depending on the nature of the construction set code 
   that uses a VCbind.
   
 * VCbinder.zip and VCbind.zip need to include maintenance instructions ?.
 
 * Change this page to describe the integration activity and not so much
   the development activity, which should be under devBinder for now.
     
 * The VCbinder.zip in this folder is the current generally-available 
   version for incorporation of its helper files into construction sets.

 0.0.10 2016-11-30-16:43 Adjust to transposition of VCbinder to nfoTools,
       cleaning up old TODOs as well.

       from the source-code version control.  
 0.0.6 2016-10-26-09:57 Tidy up.  Clarify becoming an eventual integration 
       point for an externally-maintained VCbinder.
