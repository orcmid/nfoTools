           VCBINDER KIT FOR VISUAL C/C++ COMMAND-LINE DEVELOPMENT
           ======================================================                
          
    VCbinder.zip contains VCbind.zip and some collateral files.  Include 
    VCbinder files in construction sets for command-line building of
    Microsoft Windows written in C/C++.
    
    For more about the organization and use of VCbinder, consult the 
    VCbinder-x.y.z.txt file and also the web page information at 
    <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161102b.htm>.
    
    Files with names of form VCbinder-x.y.z.txt and VCbinder-x.y.z.zip 
    in this directory are for the latest version considered stable for
    general use.
    
    The subdirectories devBind/ and devBinder/ are where versions of 
    VCbind.zip and VCbinder kits for VCbind delivery to construction
    sets are developed.

TODO

 * Get VCbinder 0.1.1 here as soon as it is ready.

 * It would be interesting to have a make process for making VCbinder.zip.

 * Add prerequisites, with links to more on satisfying the prerequisites.
  
 * Companion material that should be redistributable at the level of 
   VCbind.zip is provided along with VCbind.zip in VCbinder.zip. One thing
   that must be added by the user is any .gitignore for VCbind/ or the
   equivalent, depending on the nature of the construction set code 
   that uses a VCbind.
   
 * VCbinder.zip and VCbind.zip need to include maintenance instructions?

        Other details are at nfoWare.com and the devBinder/devBind folders.
 0.0.10 2016-11-30-16:43 Adjust to transposition of VCbinder to nfoTools,
       cleaning up old TODOs as well.
 0.0.9 2016-10-30-10:40 Poised for Expedited Provisional Use
       Expand TODOs and conclude approach for getting operation use on the
       main project.
 0.0.8 2016-10-26-11:46 Adjust to the new location at Adv10/dev/VCbinder/
 0.0.7 2016-10-26-10:07 Add .gitignore to exclude working VCbinder/ folder
       from the source-code version control.  
 0.0.6 2016-10-26-09:57 Tidy up.  Clarify becoming an eventual integration 
       point for an externally-maintained VCbinder. 
 0.0.5 2016-10-25-16:08 Switch to devBind and devBinder as the subordinate
       folders.
