          CREATE VCBINDER FOR VISUAL C/C++ COMMAND-LINE DEVELOPMENT
          =========================================================
          
                   PROVISIONAL DEVELOPMENT SOURCE CODE
                   -----------------------------------

            VCbinder/ is the source tree for development and derivation
            of VCBinder.zip versions.  VCBinder.zip delivers VCBind.zip and
            collateral files that are usable as part of construction sets
            in the source code of software projects.  The VCbinder elements
            are for development of C/C++ applications on and for Microsoft
            Windows.
            
            VCbinder is not specific to Adv10.  VCbinder does not depend on
            Adv10 in any manner.  Adv10 is the incubator for what will
            become an independent VCbinder component.  
                 
            VCbinder/ will eventually be relocated to a  separate source-
            code project for reusable components that are valuabie in a
            variety of projects using Microsoft command-line development
            tools and C/C++.
            
            While having VCbinder developed in this manner is significant
            axe sharpening for Adv10, it is a valuable as training wheels
            and learning curve for more substantial construction-set
            developments.  
                  
          
    VCbinder.zip is a package from which a development project can install
    a VCbind.zip and a couple of collateral files.  The extraction is for
    common elements of construction sets in the source code of software 
    projects.  The VCbinder elements are useful in using Windows console
    sessions for building a Windows applications on Microsoft Windows.  It is
    not necessary to redistribute VCbinder.zip although it may be convenient 
    to do so, as it is being done here.
    
    VCbind.zip, extracted from VCbinder.zip, is redistributed in the source
    code of the construction set.  Extracting VCbind.zip provides a folder
    and helper script, VCbind.bat.  Running VCbind.bat adjusts a Windows
    console session for command-line operation of the Microsoft Visual C 
    compiler and related Microsoft development tools.  
    
    The extracted script allows console session-development without
    depending on the Visual Studio (or any other) Integrated Development
    Environment (IDE), even though the tools are commonly installed as
    part of freely-available versions of Visual Studio.

TODO

 * It would be interesting to have a make process for making VCbinder.zip.
 
 * Scavenge VC.txt 0.03 from ShowDefs/VC for anything useful here.
 
 * I need VCbinder/ where I can test it and keep working it along
   with Adv10/dev/WinCom for now.  It's too bad cross-project sharing went
   the way of Visual SourceSafe. 

 * Adapt the ShowDefs experimental versions to the VCbinder structure as
   the development source for VCBind.zip redistributables.

 * Verify the structure with cmd.exe, PowerShell, TC, and MSYS2 (POSIX)
   shells and possibly CYGWIN.  It is desirable that these batch scripts work
   from underneath all of those shells.  Any usability with Linux on Windows
   needs to be investigated.

 * Add prerequisites, with links to more on satisfying the prerequisites.

 * There needs to be a location (nfoWare/devtools, likely) where illustrated
   use is provided, and the latest version can be obtained independent of the
   project that redistributes a VCbind.zip.

 * Create VCbind.zip for use in Adv10.

 * Create VCbind.bat in a way that is usable from sibling folders.  This must
   cope with the absence of a full path for the location of the source tree
   that contains a VCbind-using construction set.
   
 * There seems to be no reason to include the development source in the
   VCbind.zip itself.  Include information on location of the source code.
    
 * VCbind.zip needs to provide information on how to deploy VCbind.zip for
   anyone to incorporate it.  This might link to the maintained source, and
   it should also be complete enough for free-standing redistribution.
   
 * Companion material that should be redistributable at the level of 
   VCbind.zip is provided along with VCbind.zip in VCbinder.zip. One thing
   that must be added by the user is any .gitignore for VCbind/ or the
   equivalent, depending on the nature of the construction set code 
   that uses a VCbind.
   
 * VCbinder.zip and VCbind.zip need to include maintenance instructions ?.
 
 * Change this page to describe the integration activity and not so much
   the development activity, which should be under devBinder for now.
   
 * The VCbinder.txt file within VCbinder.zip is not this file, 
   VCbinder/VCbinder.txt.  The VCbinder.zip version is not extracted over
   this one and it does not appear in this folder. 
   
 * The VCbinder.zip in this folder is the current generally-available 
   (provisional) version that is available for use and incorporation in
   construction sets (especially for Adv10/dev/WinCon).
   
 * Don't worry about polish.  Get WinCon to a point where builds can be
   started without fussing too much about the narrative and tutorial aspects
   at this point.  That can all be filled in later.
