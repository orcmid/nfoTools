 1. OVERVIEW

    VCbind.zip delivers a Windows batch script for setting up a command-
    line environment.  The resulting environment enables compiling with the
    Microsoft Visual C/C++ command-line compiler, CL.exe, aud using related
    Microsoft developer tools.  The environment is set up and used by issuing
    commands within a Microsoft Windows console session.
    
    VCbind.zip is found as a component of larger construction sets.  Check 
    for custom instructions that apply to extraction and usage of VCbind
    in the particular construction set.
    
    Ordinarily, construction sets using VCbind version 0.2.0 have a copy 
    of this file, VCbind-0.2.0.txt, alongside the VCbind.zip file.  Use
    the version included in VCbind.zip if it is different than this one.
    
    Extract VCbind.zip at the location where it appears in a construction set.
    The result is a companion folder with the following structure.
    
               construction-set-location\
                  ...
                  VCbind.zip    *part of the construction set
                  VCbind\       *created by extraction
                     ...
                     Vcbind-0.2.0.txt
                     VCbind.bat
                  ...
                  
    The VCbind\ folder is not part of the preserved construction set.  
    Customizing the folder contents will leave the construction-set code 
    intact.  Restore the VCbind 0.2.0 parts by re-extracting VCbind.zip
    at any time.
    
    
 2. PREREQUISITES AND DEPENDENCIES
 
    To use VCbind, you will need to (1) use the Windows File Explorer, (2) 
    initiate Windows Batch (.bat) files, and (3) operate command-line
    sessions of the Windows Command Shell, cmd.exe.
 
    VCbind is designed to work with versions of Visual Studio that are free
    for personal use, from Visual Studio C++ Express 2008 to Visual Studio
    C++ Express 2015.  
    
    Use the C/C++ desktop-development options of the free Visual Studio 2015 
    Community Edition for open-source work with the Visual Studio Integrated 
    Development Environment (IDE).  If you only want Microsoft command-line 
    developer tools without the Visual Studio IDE, use the Visual Studio 
    2015 or 2013 Build Tools downloads instead.
    
    It is assumed that Microsoft Windows 7 Professional or later are used. 
    Thorough VCbind testing is with Microsoft Windows 10 Pro latest versions
    starting with Anniversary Edition version 1607.  
    
       
 3. EXTRACTION OF VCBIND.ZIP CONTENT

    In the Windows File Explorer, locate the copy of VCbind.zip that you 
    intend to use.
    
    Right click on the entry for VCbind.zip and click "Extract all ..." in
    the context menu that appears.
    
    In the "Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders" Dialog that appears,
    do not change the default "Files will be extracted to this folder:" choice.
    The automatic choice is important for other construction-set components 
    finding the VCbind content correctly.
    
    Check the "Show extracted files when complete" entry.
    
    Click "Extract".
    
    If a "Replace or Skip Files" dialog appears, click option "Replace the 
    files in the destination."  This will insert the files from VCbind 0.2.0
    without disturbing any non-VCbind files you may have added.
    
    There should now be a VCbind\ folder in the same folder as the VCbind.zip.
    In that folder you will see that the the files listed in the Manifest
    below are included.    
    
    
 4. USING THE VCBIND\VCBIND.BAT SCRIPT

    Confirm that everything is working by double-clicking on the VCbind.bat 
    file in the VCbind\ folder.  There should be a simple success report.  If
    there is a failure report, provide any remedy that is indicated.
    
    To use VCbind as part of a construction set, follow the construction-set 
    instructions for operation of a Windows Command Shell (cmd.exe) session.  
       
    The simplest use of VCbind within a console session is by plain command
    
            VCbind.bat
            
    providing a default environment using the latest-version of VC compiler
    that is detected.  This will first check whether a successful VCbind has
    already been achieved in the current session.
    
    On a successful report from VCbind.bat, confirm presence of the compiler
    with the command
    
             CL.exe
             
    in the same session.  
    
    To learn about other VCbind options, use the command form
     
            VCbind.bat ?
                 
    Detailed use of the VC compiler and other command-line development tools
    will depend on the nature of the construction set in which VCbind is 
    found.  Consult the further instructions that are provided.
    
    The VCbind-established environment does not persist beyond the current
    console session.  To have it in another session, employ VCbind.bat again
    in the manner specified for the construction set being operated.
       
    
 5. DEVELOPER USE OF VCBIND.ZIP
 
    Add VCbind.zip to personal construction sets for command-line operation
    with Visual C/C++ compilers, libraries, and tools environments.
 
    Investigate <http://nfoWare.com/2016/11/d161102.htm> for VCbinder and 
    other tips for incorporation in yout own construction sets.
    
    The source-code for the VCbind 0.2.0 release is also available at the 
    <http://nfoWare.com/2016/11/d161101d-dist> page.
    
    The public source-code project where VCbind 0.2.0 was developed is
    <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools> location devKits/WinDev/VCbinder/.
