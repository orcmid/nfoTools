                         VCBINDER PACKAGE CONSTRUCTION
                         =============================

    Folder devBinder/ provides the files and the procedure for composing
    a VCbinder distribution.  This is where the composition and testing
    occur.  When a stable distribution-point is reached, the VCbinder*.txt
    and VCbinder*.zip files are preserved at the VCbinder/ folder, allowing
    work on the next version to occur in VCbinder/devBinder without causing
    any disturbance.

    More information about VCbinder is available at <http://nfoWorks.com>.
    See <http://nfoWorks.com/dev/2016/11/d161102.htm> for further details.

MANIFEST

    NOTE: When there is development, maintenance, and testing underway
    in the origin devBinder/ folder, the working versions of VCbinder-*.txt,
    VCbinder-*.zip, VCenable.bat, VCbind.zip, VCbind-*.txt and other devBinder
    artifacts can be inconsistent until a stable distribution candidate is
    reached.

    .gitignore
        preventing any VCbind/ and VCbinder-*/ working sub-folders from
        inclusion in devBinder source-code version control.  (part of this
        source and part of VCbinder-*.zip)

    devBinder.txt
        This description and manifest for the devBinder/ folder

    LICENSE.txt 11,527 byte 2016-10-31 copy
        Apache Licnese Version 2.0 of January 2004
        (part of this source and part of VCbinder-*.zip)

    NOTICE.txt 1.00 809 byte 2016-11-29 VCbinder version
        Notice file for inclusion in VCbinder.zip
        (part of this source and part of VCbinder-*.zip)

    VCbinder-0.1.0.txt (part of VCbinder-0.1.0.zip)
        The manifest and procedure file that is incorporated in
        VCbinder-0.1.0.zip.  This provides information on the procedure
        without having to download/open VCbinder-0.1.0.zip first.
        Note that VCbinder-0.1.0.txt/.zip are not added to construction
        sets.  Selected extracts from VCbinder-0.1.0.zip are inserted
        into construction sets for Microsoft Windows programs.  The
        construction-set materials will reflect that dependency.

    VCbinder-0.1.0.zip
          The under-development VCbinder artifact for integration of
          VCbind elements into the source-code version-control of a
          construction set.

    VCensure.bat (part of VCbinder-0.1.0.zip)
        Script that can be placed in a construction set to relay into the
        VCbind\Vcbind.bat script after first checking that VCbind\VCbind.bat
        is in place.  The filename is purposefully unversioned so that it
        can always be found from other construction set components without
        need to name exact versions.

    VCbind-0.2.0.txt (part of VCbinder-0.1.0.zip)
        manifest and description included in VCbind.zip and usable as a
        preview of instructions for extraction and usage.
         copy of the same file from VCbind.zip so that it can be read before
         any VCbind.zip extraction, as may be desired.

    VCbind.zip (part of VCbinder-0.1.0.zip)
         The VCbind 0.2.0 package procedure delivered in the developing
         VCbinder.  VCbind.zip versions are developed in sibling folder
         devBind/

TODO

       In addition to these TODO items, the web-facing material on
       <http://nfoWare.com> has a Diary and Job Jar of VCbinder items
       at <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161102a.htm>.

 * Provide the construction procedure.

 * Find a way to do the VCbind.zip extraction automatically, if simple enough.

 * Speed up this work just enought to expedite confirmation and provisional
   use.

 * There needs to be some useful content on how VCensure works on first-
   succcess and then how it is used by tool-chain components simply to
   ensure there is one and only provide a default setup if there is not
   already a successful setup.  This raises the coupling between VCensure
   and VCbind somewhat.

 * Add the design point and 5Ps to this material.

 * We are going to need release notes, known limitations, etc., not unlike
   a small man-page creation.  So there might need to be a VCensure*.txt
   file?

 * There should be links to supporting information in all error messages.

 * Adjust VCensure.bat to provide for proper :USAGE chaining when spliced and
   when not.

 * Get the :USAGE working properly in Adv10Build.bat.

 * Change :USAGE chaining from Adv10Run.bat through VCbind.bat so that
   it can be provided progressively.  This is needed because outer
   scripts should not know precise details of inner parameters even though
   the basic structure is understood.  Also, common outer parameters should
   not be repeated.

 * The convention for :USAGE chaining is as follows.  If embedded ("+"),
   do not repeat common information in the definitions.  Only describe
   the parameters that are acted on uniquelly by a given script.  When
   the next level is not available, just report the case that is defined
   lower, whether embedded or not.

 * I think I am over-thinking all of this. Branches should be used for
   developing new versions and then merging into the main.  At the same
   time, I want to keep the historical versions somewhere that accounts
   for the progression, provenance, and history.  And I don't want to
   over-constrain the problem.  So there might be branches to appeal to
   in the kits.  Umm, still over-thinking?
