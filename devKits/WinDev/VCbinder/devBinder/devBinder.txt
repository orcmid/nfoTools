                         VCBINDER PACKAGE CONSTRUCTION
                         =============================

    Folder devBinder/ provides the files and the procedure for composing
    a VCbinder distribution.  This is where the composition and testing 
    occur.  When a stable distribution-point is reached, the VCbinder*.txt
    and VCbinder*.zip files are preserved at the VCbinder/ folder, allowing
    work on the next version to occur in VCbinder/devBinder without causing
    any disturbance.

MANIFEST

    NOTE: When there is development, maintenance, and testing underway 
    in the origin devBinder/ folder, the working versions of VCbinder-*.txt,
    VCbinder-*.zip, VCenable.bat, VCbind.zip, VCbind-*.txt and other devBinder
    artifacts can be inconsistent until a stable case is reached.

    .gitignore
        preventing any VCbind/ and VCbinder-*/ working sub-folders from
        inclusion in devBinder source-code version control.  (part of this
        source and part of VCbinder-*.zip)
        
    devBinder.txt
        This description and manifest for the devBinder/ folder
        
    LICENSE.txt
        Apache License Version 2.0
        (part of this source and part of VCbinder-x.y.z.zip)
         
    NOTICE.txt
        Notice file for inclusion in VCbinder.zip
        (part of this source and part of VCbinder-*.zip)
        
    VCbinder-0.1.1.txt (part of VCbinder-0.1.1.zip)
        The manifest and procedure file that is incorporated in 
        VCbinder-0.1.1.zip.  This provides information on the procedure
        without having to download/open VCbinder-0.1.1.zip first.
        Note that VCbinder-0.1.1.txt/.zip are not added to construction
        sets.  It is selected extracts from VCbinder-0.1.1.zip that
        usually go into construction sets for Microsoft Windows programs.
               
    VCenable.bat (part of VCbinder-*.zip)
        Script that can be placed in a construction set to relay into the
        VCbind\Vcbind.bat script after first checking that VCbind\VCbind.bat
        is in place.  This file is purposefully not versioned, so that it
        can always be found from other construction set components without
        need to name the exact version.
        
    VCbind-0.1.1.txt (part of VCbinder-0.1.1.zip)
         copy of the same file from VCbind.zip so that it can be read before
         any VCbind.zip extraction, as may be desired.
         
    VCbind.zip (part of VCbinder-0.1.1.zip)
         The VCbind 0.1.1 package procedure delivered in the developing
         VCbinder.  VCbind.zip versions are developed in sibling folder 
         devBind/
         
    VCbinder-0.1.1.zip
          The under-development VCbinder artifact for integration of 
          VCbind elements into the source-code version-control of a 
          construction set.

TODO

       In addition to these TODO items, the web-facing material on 
       <http://nfoWare.com> has a Diary and Job Jar of VCbinder items
       at <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161102a.htm>.

 * Provide the construction procedure.
  
 * The VCenable.bat here is used to check that VCbind.zip is present and that
   the extracted VCbind\VCbind.bat file is present for use.  If Vcbind.zip
   has not been extracted, the user will be instructed to extract it and
   retry.
   
 * We need a way to have the VCbind messages from under VCenable not be too
   confusing.  So VCenable will need to somehow present as if it is part of
   VCbind.bat or somehow blending in.  This also impacts the handling of
   displaying in a cleared screen or in a terse form.  It may take some
   adjustment to VCbind.bat to have these play nicely together.
   
 * Find a way to do the VCbind.zip extraction automatically, if simple enough.
    
 * Speed up this work just enought to expedite confirmation and provisional
   use.
