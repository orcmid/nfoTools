                      RAYLIB APP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
                      ==============================

<https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/blob/master/devKits/WinDev/VCrayApp/VCrayApp.txt>

                 DEVELOPING THE VCRAYAPP CONSTRUCTION KIT
                 ----------------------------------------

    VCrayApp is a construction set for building raylib applications on Windows
    using Microsoft C/C++ tools and producing Microsoft Windows graphical
    software, especially games.

    VCrayApp is delivered in a .zip file that can be extracted, customized,
    and used. Pre-customized VCrayApp kits can also be enclosed in the body
    of raylib-using software projects and delivered in the repositories of
    those projects.

    dev\ and its content mimics the recommended installation of a VCrayApp
    extraction, with raylib installed as a peer folder.  The VCrayApp 0.0.0
    organization and rayApp.bat depend on that.

    VCrayApp is a cousin of the VCbuild construction kit, and modeled on
    that.  It also borrows from the raylib\projects\scripts\build-windows.bat
    script and relies on a comparable structure with cache\ and \app folders.
    The verification of VCrayApp-0.0.0 is by usage in confirming all of the
    raylib\templates\ and raylib\examples.  This is accomplished in the GitHub
    orcmid/rayLab project using the raylib release in the raylib\ folder here.

MANIFEST

    VCrayApp.txt
        This manifest and job jar for the VCrayApp construction-kit
        development project

    .gitignore
        Keeping raylib\ here out of the winDev\VCrayApp repository

    raylib-3.7.0.zip
        The raylib 3.7.0 release zip used in confirming operation of
        VCrayApp at this time.
    raylib\
        The Zipped raylib-3.7.0\ folder extracted to here and renamed
        raylib\ for consistent reference from a VCrayApp-organized
        project (excluded from Git, extract from the .zip in any clone)

    dev\
        Developer setup for the VCrayApp materials under current development.
        A version of VCrayApp structure before packaging in a release Zip.
        This is always work-in-progress.  Releases are in docs\dev\ folders.

TODO

 * Derive a VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip and employ it in orcmid/RayLab to confirm the
   templates and examples.

 * Create docs/dev/ folio(s) on VCrayApp and link from VCrayApp-0.0.0 content.

 * In VCrayApp.bat, have places for error messages to link to that provide
   more information on resolving a particular failure.

 * Resolve use of docs/dev connections back and forth on raylib at docs/tools.

 * Do a beta availability and distribution once there is a docs/dev folder
   for feedback and information.
