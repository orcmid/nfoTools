                       DEVELOPING THE VCRAYAPP TEMPLATE
                       ================================

<https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/blob/master/devKits/WinDev/VCrayApp/VCrayApp.txt>

                       RAYLIB APP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
                       ------------------------------

    This is the area for development of the materials that go into a VCrayApp
    release Zip.

    dev\ and its content mimics the recommended installation of a VCrayApp
    extraction, with raylib installed as a peer folder.  The VCrayApp 0.0.0
    organization and rayApp.bat depend on that.

    VCrayApp.bat is based on the raylib\projects\scripts\build-windows.bat
    script and relies on a comparable structure with cache\ and \app folders.
    The verification of VCrayApp-0.0.0 is by usage in confirming all of the
    raylib\templates\ and raylib\examples.  This is accomplished in the GitHub
    orcmid/rayLab project.

MANIFEST

    VCrayApp.txt
        This manifest and job jar for the nfoTools WinDev VCrayApp template
        development project

    .gitignore
        Keeping raylib\ here out of the winDev\VCrayApp repository

    raylib-3.7.0.zip
        The raylib 3.7.0 release zip used in confirming operation of
        VCrayApp at this time.
    raylib\
        The Zipped raylib-3.7.0\ folder extracted to here and renamed
        raylib\ for consistent reference from a VCrayApp-organized
        project (excluded from Git, extract from the .zip in any clone)

    dev\
        Developer setup for the VCrayApp materials under current development.
        a version of VCrayApp structure before packaging in a release Zip.
        This is always work-in-progress.  Releases are in docs\dev\ folders.
