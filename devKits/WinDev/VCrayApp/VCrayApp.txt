                      RAYLIB APP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
                      ==============================

<https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/blob/master/devKits/WinDev/VCrayApp/VCrayApp.txt>

                 DEVELOPING THE VCRAYAPP CONSTRUCTION KIT
                 ----------------------------------------

    VCrayApp is a construction set for building raylib applications on Windows
    using Microsoft C/C++ tools and producing Microsoft Windows graphical
    software, especially games.

    VCrayApp is delivered in a .zip file that can be extracted, customized,
    and used. Pre-customized VCrayApp kits can also be enclosed in the body
    of raylib-using software projects and delivered in the repositories of
    those projects.

    dev\ and its content mimics the recommended installation of a VCrayApp
    extraction, with raylib installed as a peer folder.  The VCrayApp
    organization and VCrayApp.bat script depend on such relative proximity.

    VCrayApp releases are subject to semantic versioning.  The three-numeral
    *semver* starts with 0.0.0 for the initial alpha release and progresses
    from that value, basically major.minor.patch levels.

    VCrayApp is a cousin of the VCbuild construction kit, and modeled on
    that.  It also borrows from the raylib\projects\scripts\build-windows.bat
    script and relies on a comparable structure with cache\ and \app folders.
    The verification of VCrayApp-*semver* is by usage in confirming all of the
    raylib\templates\ and raylib\examples.  This is accomplished in the GitHub
    orcmid/rayLab project using the same raylib releases as used in the
    raylib\ folder here.

MANIFEST

    VCrayApp.txt
        This manifest and job jar for the VCrayApp construction-kit
        development project

    .gitignore
        Keeping raylib\, VCrayApp\, and any raylib-*\ out of the
        winDev\VCrayApp repository.  When raylib\ is a cloned "-dev" of
        raylib, it will be under its own GitHub coordination.

    VCrayApp-checklist.txt
        Checklist of activities in the development and staging of a VCrayApp
        release.

    VCrayApp-*semver*-checklist.txt
        Checklist being consumed on behalf of preparation for the *semver*
        release.

    dev\
        Folder for the VCrayApp materials under current development.
        A version of VCrayApp structure before packaging in a release Zip.
        This is always work-in-progress.  This code is not intended for use
        by other than developers contributing to VCrayApp itself.  There
        are some files (including dev.txt there) that are not included in
        a release.

    raylib-3.5.0.zip
        The raylib 3.5.0 source release also supported by VCrayApp.
    raylib-3.7.0.zip
        The raylib 3.7.0 source release zip used in original confirmation of
        VCrayApp-0.0.0.
    raylib-4.0.0.zip
        The raylib 4.0.0 release zip used for confirming VCrayApp operation
        with the latest raylib version that works with Microsoft VC/C++.
        (See VCrayApp-0.0.0.txt for particulars)
    raylib-4.5.0.zip
        The raylib 4.5.0 release zip also used for confirming VCrayApp
        operation with VCrayApp-0.1.0 development.

    raylib\
        The Zipped raylib-x.x.0\ folder extracted to here and renamed
        raylib\ for consistent reference from a VCrayApp-organized project
        (excluded from Git, extracted from the raylib release .zip under test.
        This is at the same level as dev\ and any VCrayApp\ opened here for
        confirmation of a VCrayApp-*semver*.zip release candidate.
        When testing with the current raylib\ main (a -dev version), this
        holds a clone and is generally used for confirming under-development
        VCrayApp versions.

    VCrayApp\
        Produced by unzipping VCrayApp-*semver*.zip here and renaming it to
        VCrayApp.  This folder is also excluded from Git.  It is created for
        confirmation of any VCrayApp release candidate and located at the
        same level as raylib\ for that purpose. This is generally only done
        to ensure no regressions with an under-development raylib\

    VCrayApp-*semver* Release Materials
        The following comprise the release candidate for VCrayApp-*semver*.
        The confirmed candidate will be preserved and distributed via
        <https://orcmid.githug.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/> .  General practice
        is to download all five of the files into the same folder.  Only the
        latest set is carried here.  Previous ones can be found at D211101.

    VCrayApp-0.0.0.txt
        Synopsis, summaries, and manifest for the VCrayApp-0.0.0 alpha
        release candidate.  The file is clear-signed and the same as the one
        included in VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip.  Download and review of this file
        is useful before deciding to download the additional files.

    CHANGES.txt
        A file cataloging changes *since* the original 0.0.0 release.  These
        will also be clear-signed and availabel for download and review before
        downloading the latest package.  This should probably have a *semver*.

    VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip
        Package of the VCrayApp-0.0.0 release candidate with contents as
        described by VCrayApp-0.0.0.txt (and also included therein).

    VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip.asc
        Detached digital signature of VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip.  Verification of
        this signature confirms the source and the integrity of the .zip.

    VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip.sha256
        SHA 256 cryptographic hash of file VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip.  Verification
        of *this* hash value is evidence that the downloaded .zip (or .sha256)
        have not been altered in the downloading/redistribution and usage.

TODO

 * In general, the use of an in-progress raylib version is not covered
   for building applications that depend on raylib.  That does not
   mean feedback and fixes cannot be submitted to the project.  But there
   needs to be separation and avoidance of too much dependency on work-in-
   progress and the prospect of deprecations, alterations, and regressions.
   This does mean that careful work-arounds are required when there is any
   difficulty with a stable release. And one should not depend on new/changed
   features until they appear in a stable release, and a release schedule
   should never depend on a dependency achieving release. There are enough
   hazards that are under ones own control.

 * The beta release, VCrayApp-0.1.0 should also address the replacement of
   one release by another and all the support there is for such changes.
   Saving ones customizations, having the customizations already on the users
   source control, etc.  This should be feature complete and post-beta changes
   should not have breaking changes, though bug fixes are always a prospect.

 * These aspects of trustworthy production need to be accounted for.  There
   should also be some integration with respect to confirmable experience.

  * In VCrayApp.bat, have places for error messages to link to that provide
   more information on resolving a particular failure.

 * Resolve use of docs/dev connections back and forth on raylib at docs/tools.

 * It is not possible to provide VCrayApp as the basis for learning C/C++
   programming.  This must be emphasized in some manner.  We do want on-ramps
   and guard rails, but the basics of C Language programming need to be
   developed elsewhere.  There is also quite a bit to understand about the
   thread on which the app runs and how the cycle works with regard to the
   presentation and interaction with the display and input devices.

 * Fold the VCrayApp model back to an update of VCbuild that uses a similar
   structure for for src, cache, and app in generic construction projects of
   single executables.

 * The project VCrayVerify needs to be usable in confirming that all examples
   build properly with a release candidate.  Recent improvements for VCrayApp
   0.1.0 will make it easier to drop in a fresh VCrayApp candidate.  This will
   usually work against the main -dev raylib code to anticipate problems and
   provide feedback to the raylib project as appropriate.

 * The technique in VCbind for choosing a start configuration should work for
   VCrayVerify.  Then a technique for doing only one instead of running the
   table should also work.  Because there are 9 groups of raylib\example
   folders, it is probably good to have some sort of granularity in which
   examples are verified, including how many. Might want some sort of wild-
   card scheme, and must deal with * being use in VCbind and VCrayApp for
   other purposes.  Need this to be simple.
