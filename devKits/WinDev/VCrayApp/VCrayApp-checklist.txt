        o Link to additional information on MSIX deployment
        o Address single-use versus multiple-use installation
        o Provide orcmid.github.io/nfoTools location for the attribution

    * cache\
        o Update cache.txt to version of VCrayApp
        o Indicate purpose of cache\
        o Link to information on the compilation option files
        o Link to explanation of the compilation steps
        o Provide orcmid.github.io/nfoTools location for the attribution
        o Ensure that the cache components work with the version of raylib
          being used

    * cache\rayConfirm.c
        o Adjust version-specific information
        o Adjust VCrayApp package identification

    * VCrayApp.bat
        o Set the semantic version variable, VCrayApp
        o Provide the <place-to-be-announced> as the location for VCrayApp
          dev location
        o Provide the <related-place-to-be-announced> as the location for
          the latest VCrayApp download, etc.
        o Determine PAUSE default for non-"+" compiles on success
        o For FAIL6 provide a better indication of the location of raylib/src
        o For FAIL6 provide a link to the requirement to check and also
          consider the case where the location of raylib has been changed
        o For FAIL5 provide information on how to check for compilation
          errors and determine the nature of the failure
        o For FAIL5 find a way to provoke this case to demonstrate it
        o For FAIL4 do similar things - collect typical errors such as
          misspellings and incompatibility with a raylib version
        o For FAIL3 provide a link to <some nfoTools support information>
          specifically on being under a developer Command Prompt session.
        o For FAIL1 provide <other nfoTools support information. on the
          correct unpacking and preservation of VCrayApp in a folder.

    * VCrayApp-semver.txt
        o Ensure place-holder under D211101x subfolder.

    * Signatures and hash checks.
        o Have a dev procedure for the methodology and how it is done.
        o This could be in docs/dev/ but maybe something n dev also?
        o Find what I had for this with VCbind and how I demonstrated stuff,
          where I provided information on it.

TODO

 * Use development of VCrayApp-0.0.0 alpha release for development of the
   initial checklist.

 * Decide whether to stick with raylib 3.7.0 or go to raylib 4.0.0.  Maybe
   save 4.0.0 for the beta release.

 * Include statement on the use of raylib source-code releases, not any other
   form.

 * I intend to make VCrayApp-0.0.x available as an alpha release, inviting
   exploration and employment by interested users of raylib.  This means I
   need to update the text files and also have something on docs/dev for the
   alpha release.

 * The beta release, VCrayApp-0.1.0 should also address the replacement of
   one release by another and all the support there is for such changes.
   Saving ones customizations, having the customizations already on the users
   source control, etc.  This should be feature complete and post-beta changes
   should not have breaking changes, though bug fixes are always a prospect.

 * These aspects of trustworthy production need to be accounted for.  There
   should also be some integration with respect to confirmable experience.

 * In VCrayApp.bat, have places for error messages to link to that provide
   more information on resolving a particular failure.

 * Resolve use of docs/dev connections back and forth on raylib at docs/tools.

 * Do alpha/beta availability and distribution once there is a docs/dev folder
   for downloading, usage information, and gathering feedback.

 * .vscode/.vscode.txt needs further details including what happens with
   user *.h files in the src/ folder.  Intellisense will work for all of
   the subfolders, that needs to be explained.

 * Provide a checklist for projects built and deployed using VCrayApp.

 * Distinguish local, used-by-developer usage and standalone deployments
   for simple usage and then more-elaborate distribution.

 * Include the procedure for signing the various materials, especially the
   VCrayApp-v.m.n.zip and the text files.

 * Customization instructions must specify some things about what to do with
   signed materials.
