                    VCRAYAPP FAILCODE0 DEMONSTRATION TEST


Try cmd /y to disable command extensions for this session, /x enables
<https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/cmd>
indicates that /e:off is the ticket.
I shall try
    cmd /k /e:off VCrayApp + ?
The way to tell if COMMAND EXTENSIONS are not set is to do a test on
%CMDEXTVERSION%.  I think we want it to be 2.  Yes.

We cannot do anything with this in VCrayApp-0.1.0, but for 1.0.0 we will
Use the environment variable.

For VCrayApp-0.1.0 we force this by jimmying VCrayApp.bat to always fail.
