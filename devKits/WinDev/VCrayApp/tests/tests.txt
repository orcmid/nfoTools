                  TEST/DEMO CASES FOR VCRAYAPP RELEASES
                  -------------------------------------

    Files in this directory are for different test cases used to confirm
    or demonstrate cases of VCrayApp usage and operation.

    Some of these involve mangling of the VCrayApp setup, so there is
    enough information here to allow for restoration of VCrayApp to the
    dev\ or basic installation version.
