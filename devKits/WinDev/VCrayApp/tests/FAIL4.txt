                    VCRAYAPP FAILCODE4 DEMONSTRATION TEST


Having the cache build fail is tricky.  It is about the specific operations
for compiling the cache raylib *.obj files.

I accomplish this by forcing the case in VCrayApp.bat.

Then I do the 3 screen shots that go with the VCrayApp-0.1.0 correct cases
to be checked.
