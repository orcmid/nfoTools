TODO

 * Use development of VCrayApp-0.0.0 alpha release for development of the
   initial checklist.

 * Decide whether to stick with raylib 3.7.0 or go to raylib 4.0.0.  Maybe
   save 4.0.0 for the beta release.

 * Include statement on the use of raylib source-code releases, not any other
   form.

 * I intend to make VCrayApp-0.0.x available as an alpha release, inviting
   exploration and employment by interested users of raylib.  This means I
   need to update the text files and also have something on docs/dev for the
   alpha release.

 * The beta release, VCrayApp-0.1.0 should also address the replacement of
   one release by another and all the support there is for such changes.
   Saving ones customizations, having the customizations already on the users
   source control, etc.  This should be feature complete and post-beta changes
   should not have breaking changes, though bug fixes are always a prospect.

 * These aspects of trustworthy production need to be accounted for.  There
   should also be some integration with respect to confirmable experience.

 * In VCrayApp.bat, have places for error messages to link to that provide
   more information on resolving a particular failure.

 * Resolve use of docs/dev connections back and forth on raylib at docs/tools.

 * Do alpha/beta availability and distribution once there is a docs/dev folder
   for downloading, usage information, and gathering feedback.

 * .vscode/.vscode.txt needs further details including what happens with
   user *.h files in the src/ folder.  Intellisense will work for all of
   the subfolders, that needs to be explained.
