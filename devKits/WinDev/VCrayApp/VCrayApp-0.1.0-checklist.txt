                      RAYLIB APP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
                      ==============================

<https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/blob/master/devKits/WinDev/VCrayApp/VCrayApp-checklist.txt>

          VCRAYAPP RELEASE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
          -----------------------------------------------------

    This is the scratchpad checklist that will be worked through for the
    major breaking change to the VCrayApp command-line usage.  It is taken
    from VCrayApp-checklist.txt 0.0.9 with possible merging of later changes
    (such as for documentation).

   * VCrayApp-*semver*-checklist.txt
        o Changes/improvements noticed should be transposed into the
          main checklist also.

    * .vscode\
        o Provide link to more explanation of VS Code workspace setup and
          the limited use of the c_cpp_properties.json
        o The establishment of .vscode folders may have changed recently.
          Work that out and confirm or not in the web materials.

    * app\app.txt
        o Explain Xcopy/Zip deployment
        o Explain setting up for command-line/shortcut execution
        o Link to additional information on Zip deployment
        o Link to additional information on MSIX deployment
        o Address single-use versus multiple-use installation


    * cache\
        o Ensure that the cache components work with the version of raylib
          being used

    * cache\VCrayVerCheck.c

    * cache\VCrayConfirm.c

    * VCrayApp.bat
        o Redo the capture of all the FAILCODEs for the documentation.
        o Also ensure there are good captures of normal situations, with or
          without warnings, with or without terse.
        o Document all of the cases.
        o Point to where the particular CMD command prompt customization
          is documented.
        o FAILCODE8

    * See if I can also compile C++ this way.  No, the /TC option interferes,
      and so do the /SUBSYTEM /MAINENTRY options.

    * Ensure rational operation when VCrayApp is embedded in a project and
      hosted in a script of that project.  This is done with VCrayVerify but
      other cases might be needed.

    * Review the tests\ for anything that needs to be replicated, especially
      for confirming error behavior.

DEPLOYMENT


    *** TODO: The download for this needs to describe how to check the
      verify the signature, the clearsigned VCrayApp-*semver*.txt.
    * Create the SHA256 Hash of the VCrayApp-*semver*.zip for usage also.
      This can be done running certUtil -hashfile (file) SHA256 >(file).SHA256
    * Explore use of winget hash for making SHA256 hashes and see if that
      works as well.  This might be a better alternative for command-line
      operation on current Windows 10/11.

    * The signature check works with gpg --verify naming either the .txt
      version or the .asc/.sig detached signature.

TODO

 * The beta release, VCrayApp-0.1.0 should address the replacement of
   one release by another and all the support there is for such changes.
   Saving ones customizations, having the customizations already on the users
   source control, etc.  This should be feature complete and post-beta changes
   should not have breaking changes, though bug fixes are always a prospect.

 * These aspects of trustworthy production need to be accounted for.  There
   should also be some integration with respect to confirmable experience.

 * Resolve use of docs/dev connections back and forth on raylib at docs/tools.

 * .vscode/.vscode.txt needs further details including what happens with
   user *.h files in the src/ folder.  Intellisense will work for all of
   the subfolders, that needs to be explained.

 * Provide a checklist for projects built and deployed using VCrayApp.

 * Distinguish local, used-by-developer usage and standalone deployments
   for simple usage and then more-elaborate distribution.

 * Include the procedure for signing the various materials, especially the
   VCrayApp-v.m.n.zip and the text files.

 * Customization instructions must specify some things about what to do with
   signed materials.

 * Include documentation and also CHANGES inclusion more specifically.  There
   are multiple kinds of changes needed to D211101.
