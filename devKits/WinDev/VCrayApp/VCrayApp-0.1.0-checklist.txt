                      RAYLIB APP DEVELOPMENT PROJECT
                      ==============================

<https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/blob/master/devKits/WinDev/VCrayApp/VCrayApp-checklist.txt>

          VCRAYAPP RELEASE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
          -----------------------------------------------------

    This is the scratchpad checklist that will be worked through for the
    major breaking change to the VCrayApp command-line usage.  It is taken
    from VCrayApp-checklist.txt 0.0.9 with possible merging of later changes
    (such as for documentation).

   * VCrayApp-*semver*-checklist.txt
        o Make a *semver* checklist copy and start working through it.
        o Reflect changes/improvements noticed should be transposed into the
          main checklist also.

    * .vscode\
        o Provide link to more explanation of VS Code workspace setup and
          the limited use of the c_cpp_properties.json
        o The establishment of .vscode folders may have changed recently.
          Work that out and confirm or not in the web materials.

    * app\app.txt
        o Explain Xcopy/Zip deployment
        o Explain setting up for command-line/shortcut execution
        o Link to additional information on Zip deployment
        o Link to additional information on MSIX deployment
        o Address single-use versus multiple-use installation


    * cache\
        o Ensure that the cache components work with the version of raylib
          being used


    * cache\VCrayVerCheck.c
        o Adjust version-specific information
        o Adjust VCrayApp package identification
        o Clear/armor sign the VCrayVerCheck.c

    * cache\VCrayConfirm.c
        o Adjust version-specific information
        o Adjust VCrayApp package identification
        o Clear/armor sign the VCrayConfirm.c file

    * VCrayApp.bat
        o Set the semantic version variable, VCrayApp
        o Provide the <place-to-be-announced> as the location for VCrayApp
          dev location
        o Provide the <related-place-to-be-announced> as the location for
          the latest VCrayApp download, etc.
        o Determine PAUSE default for non-"+" compiles on success
        o For FAIL6 provide a better indication of the location of raylib/src
        o For FAIL6 provide a link to the requirement to check and also
          consider the case where the location of raylib has been changed
        o For FAIL5 provide information on how to check for compilation
          errors and determine the nature of the failure
        o For FAIL5 find a way to provoke this case to demonstrate it
        o For FAIL4 do similar things - collect typical errors such as
          misspellings and incompatibility with a raylib version
        o For FAIL3 provide a link to <some nfoTools support information>
          specifically on being under a developer Command Prompt session.
        o For FAIL1 provide <other nfoTools support information. on the
          correct unpacking and preservation of VCrayApp in a folder.

    * VCrayApp-semver.txt
        o Ensure place-holder under D211101x subfolder.

    * Include CHANGES.txt and keep it current as development of a new
      release is underway.  It will be included in the VCrayApp zip and be
      downloadable separately via D211101.
        o Clear/Armor sign CHANGES.txt

    * Review the Notice to be current and complete
        o Clear/Armor sign NOTICE.txt

    * Ensure rational operation when VCrayApp is embedded in a project and
      hosted in a script of that project.  This is done with VCrayVerify but
      other cases might be needed.


DEPLOYMENT

    * Use the VCBind model
    * For the manifest, do gpg --clear-sign --armor VCrayApp-*semver*.txt
      To produce VCrayApp-*semver*.txt.asc.  Get this to correctly describe
      itself as the *.txt file.  Then delete the *.txt file and rename the
      *.txt.asc file to *.txt.  This should be checked in.
    * Make the VCrayApp-*semver*.zip of everything but the dev.txt file.
      Copy the two VCrayApp-*semver* files to the VCrayApp level.  Delete
      the *.zip in the dev/ folder.
    * Create the gpg --detach-sign --armor VCrayApp-*semver*.zip and that
      will make VCrayApp-*semver*.zip.asc as the detached signature.
    *** TODO: The download for this needs to describe how to check the
      verify the signature, the clearsigned VCrayApp-*semver*.txt.
    * Create the SHA256 Hash of the VCrayApp-*semver*.zip for usage also.
      This can be done running certUtil -hashfile (file) SHA256 >(file).SHA256
    * Explore use of winget hash for making SHA256 hashes and see if that
      works as well.  This might be a better alternative for command-line
      operation on current Windows 10/11.

    * The signature check works with gpg --verify naming either the .txt
      version or the .asc detached signature.

    * The hash can be checked by comparison, which is not much fun.  There
      seems to be no check utility and that's just too bad.  THIS SHOULD BE
      AN NFOTOOLS PROJECT.  It seems that Winget hash works a little better.
      I could probably do a hash to a file and then do a file compare.  That
      might be a lot better.

    * Ensure that GIT and the site treat .asc and .sha256 as text/plain. That
      is the default.  We need to figure out if clear-sign armor files check
      properly whichever way line ends are encoded: CR/LF or just one or the
      other.  XXX: THIS MAY BE A FRAGILE DEAL.

TODO

 * The beta release, VCrayApp-0.1.0 should address the replacement of
   one release by another and all the support there is for such changes.
   Saving ones customizations, having the customizations already on the users
   source control, etc.  This should be feature complete and post-beta changes
   should not have breaking changes, though bug fixes are always a prospect.

 * These aspects of trustworthy production need to be accounted for.  There
   should also be some integration with respect to confirmable experience.

 * In VCrayApp.bat, have places for error messages to link to that provide
   more information on resolving a particular failure.

 * Resolve use of docs/dev connections back and forth on raylib at docs/tools.

 * Do alpha/beta availability and distribution once there is a docs/dev folder
   for downloading, usage information, and gathering feedback.

 * .vscode/.vscode.txt needs further details including what happens with
   user *.h files in the src/ folder.  Intellisense will work for all of
   the subfolders, that needs to be explained.

 * Provide a checklist for projects built and deployed using VCrayApp.

 * Distinguish local, used-by-developer usage and standalone deployments
   for simple usage and then more-elaborate distribution.

 * Include the procedure for signing the various materials, especially the
   VCrayApp-v.m.n.zip and the text files.

 * Customization instructions must specify some things about what to do with
   signed materials.

 * Include documentation and also CHANGES inclusion more specifically.  There
   are multiple kinds of changes needed to D211101.
