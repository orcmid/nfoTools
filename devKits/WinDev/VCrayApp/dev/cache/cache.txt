  *      DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILE. VCRAYAPP.BAT REQUIRES ONE HERE          *
  *      *******************************************************          *
  *                                                                       *
  *    cache\ serves double-duty for VCrayApp.  It contains supporting    *
  *    files and a setup confirmation file for demonstrating successful   *
  *    compilation.  It is also the location for a cache of compiled      *
  *    raylib *.obj files that can be incorporation in the project .exe   *
  *    without taking the time to compile them every time.                *
  *                                                                       *
  *    If VCrayApp is re-extracted or is updated and extracted, this      *
  *    file and all other files of the new manifest will be replaced. If  *
  *    any *.opt files have been altered, they should first be renamed    *
  *    for protection against being over-written.  Then use those for     *
  *    review and adjustment of the restored/updated versions.            *
  *                                                                       *
  *  CRITICAL IMPORTANCE.  Rebuild the cache (using VCrayApp option "-c") *
  *    every time the raylib\ folder is populated or updated.  If this is *
  *    not done, there is risk that the raylib header files accessed in   *
  *    the project will not be compatible with the *.obj files in the     *
  *    cache.                                                             *
  *                                                                       *

  *    RAYLIB-4.2.0 CANNOT BE USED WITH VCRAYAPP because of a defect in   *
  *    the external/miniaudio.h file depended upon by raudio.c.  The bug  *
  *    prevents VCrayApp compiling with any version of Microsoft VC/C++.  *
  *    Raylib 4.0.0 and 4.5.0 are supported.  For the situation with      *
  *    later versions of raylib, check the page                           *
  *    <https://orcmid.github/nfoTools/D211101/D21101e> and also check    *
  *    whether a later version of VCrayApp is recommended/required        *
  *                                                                       *
  *    RAYLIB-3.0.0 CANNOT BE USED WITH VCRAYAPP because of a defect in   *
  *    the src/external/stb_image.h file causing incompatibility with     *
  *    Microsoft VC/C++.                                                  *

  *    VCrayApp is not supported for raylib versions earlier than 3.5.0.  *
  *                                                                       *

    cache/ contains compilation materials, setup confirmation programs, and
    compiled raylib files that become a pre-compiled library to the project.

    When the cache has been populated with compiled raylib code, new compiles
    will avoid the time it would take to compile that code again.

    Using a cache in this manner, with the applicable compilation *.opt files,
    ensures that the compiled raylib *.obj files and the user compiled files
    are always compatible.

    IMPORTANT DEPENDENCY: The VCrayApp.bat file (in the folder above cache/)
    and the option files raylibCode-x.y.z.opt and VCoptions.opt all depend on
    relative location of a raylib/ source-code folder.  These must be altered
    together for any change to relative location (including use of an absolute
    location).  The use of relative addresses also requires that VCrayApp be
    installed on the same drive as the raylib\ release code.

    For more information, see <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101>.

    For details of the *.opt files and how they are employed with vCrayApp
    0.1.0, see <https://orcmid.guthub.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/D211101e>.

MANIFEST

    cache.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file

    .gitignore
        excluding the compilation intermediates and other ephemeral files
        from any git commits.

    rayAppLinking.opt
        Parameters for linking the compiled raylib app and the cache of
        raylib *.obj files into an .exe program in app\.

    rayConfirmLinking.opt
        Parameters for linking the compiled VCrayConfirm.c into the
        VCrayConfirm.exe in cache\

    raylibCode.opt
        Ephemerial file chosen depending on the version of Raylib that is
        be cached.

    raylibCode.3.x.0.opt
        Option file to be copied to raylibCode.opt when using an acceptable
        raylib 3.x release.

    raylibCode.4.x.0.opt
        Option file copied to raylibCode.opt when using an acceptable
        raylib-4.x or raylib-4.x-dev.

    raylibVars.opt
        Preprocessor definitions for the compilation of the raylib modules

    VCoptions.opt
        Compilation options for Visual C/C++ native compiler cl.exe.
        These options are the same between cache\ and app\ compiles.  This
        file also depends on raylib\ being in the same predictable relative
        location as relied on in raylibCode.opt.

    VCrayConfirm.c
        sample program used to confirm the setup and building of a raylib
        application with VS Build Tools.

    VCrayVer.bat
        Is an ephemeral file that holds the script output by VCrayVercheck.exe
        for delivering VCRAYVER to VCrayApp.bat for refinement and verifying
        that the raylib version is acceptable for use with VCrayApp.

    VCrayVerCheck.c
        C Language program that is compiled as part of the cache\ population
        procedure.  It determines whatever version is identified, if any,
        in the file raylib.h.

    *.obj (after compilation of cached raylib components)
        VC/C++ compiled C Language *.obj modules from compilation of the
        raylib files identified in raylibCode.opt.  Other *.obj files created
        here are removed to avoid tainting VCrayApp linking of cache files.

    *.exe files in cache\ are all ephemeral biproducts of the cache creation
        process.
