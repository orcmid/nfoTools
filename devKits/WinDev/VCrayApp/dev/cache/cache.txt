                     RAYAPP APPLICATION-BUILD TEMPLATE
                     =================================

            VCRAYAPP.ZIP TEMPLATE FOR RAYLIB NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                         RAYAPP RAYLIB CACHE FOLDER
                         --------------------------

    cache/ contains compilation materials, a setup confirmation program, and
    compiled files of raylib that become a library of code to the project.

    When the cache has been populated with the compiled raylib code, new
    compiles will avoid the time it takes to compile that code again.

    For more information, see ******* TBD *******.

MANIFEST

    cache.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file
    .gitignore
        excluding the compilation intermediates and supporting files from
        any git commits

    rayConfirm.c
        part of the raylib setup, used to confirm and demonstrate building
        of a raylib application with VS Build Tools and, optionally, VS Code.
        Once setup is confirmed, the rayAppBuild.bat can be changed to compile
        the user's raylib project src/ files.

    raylibCode.opt
        Option file identifying the raylib modules to be cached.  This file
        depends on raylib\ being in a predictable location relative to the
        location of cache\.  raylib\src\rglfw.c must be the last one compiled.

    raylibVars.opt
        Preprocessor definitions for the compilation of raylib modules.

    rayLinking.opt
        Parameters for linking the compiled raylib app into an executable

    VCoptions.opt
        Compilation options for Visual C/C++ native compiler cl.exe.
        These options are the same between cache\ and app\ compiles.  This
        file also depends on raylib\ being in the same predictable relative
        location as raylibCode.opt.

    *.obj
        Microsoft compiled C Language *.obj modules from compilation of the
        raylib files identified in raylibCode.opt.  If rglfw.obj is not
        present, the cache is considered to be incomplete or empty and all
        files specified in raylibCode.opt will be compiled.
