  *    cache\ serves double-duty for VCrayApp.  It contains supporting    *
  *    files and a setup confirmation file for demonstrating successful   *
  *    compilation.  It is also the location for a cache of compiled      *
  *    raylib *.obj files that can be incorporation in the project .exe   *
  *    without taking the time to compile them every time.                *

  *    If VCrayApp is re-extracted or is updated and extracted, this      *

  *    any *.opt files have been altered, they should first be renamed    *
  *    for protection against being over-wrottine.  Then use those for    *

    cache/ contains compilation materials, a setup confirmation program, and
    compiled files of raylib that become a library of code to the project.

    When the cache has been populated with compiled raylib code, new compiles
    will avoid the time it would take to compile that code again.

    Using a cache in this manner, with the applicable compilation *.opt files,
    ensures that the compiled raylib *.obj files and the user compiled files
    are always compatible.

    IMPORTANT DEPENDENCY: The VCrayApp.bat file (in the folder above cache/)
    and the option files raylibCode.opt and VCoptions.opt all depend on
    relative location of a raylib/ source-code folder.  These must be altered
    together for any change to relative location (including use of an absolute
    location).  This is because environment variables are not recognized and
    processed in *.opt files.  The use of relative addresses also requires
    that VCrayApp be installed on the same drive as raylib release code.

    For more information, see ******* TBD *******.

MANIFEST

    cache.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file

    .gitignore
        excluding the compilation intermediates from any git commits. The
        *.obj files should always be excluded because they are temporary
        and should be rebuilt as needed, not backed-up under version control.

    rayConfirm.c
        sample program used to confirm the setup and building of a raylib
        application with VS Build Tools.  Once setup is confirmed,
        VCrayApp.bat can be modified to compile the user's rayApp project src\
        files.  See the instructions at the beginning of VCrayApp.bat.

    raylibCode.opt
        Option file identifying the raylib ***3.7.0*** source modules to be
        compiled and their *.obj files cached.  This file depends on raylib\
        being at a fixed location relative to cache\. raylib\src\rglfw.c must
        be the last one successfully compiled.  It's presence is checked to
        confirm that a complete cache is available.

    raylibVars.opt
        Preprocessor definitions for the compilation of the raylib modules.

    rayLinking.opt
        Parameters for linking the compiled raylib app and the cache of
        raylib *.obj files into a .exe program

    VCoptions.opt
        Compilation options for Visual C/C++ native compiler cl.exe.
        These options are the same between cache\ and app\ compiles.  This
        file also depends on raylib\ being in the same predictable relative
        location as relied on in raylibCode.opt.

    *.obj
        VC/C++ compiled C Language *.obj modules from compilation of the
        raylib files identified in raylibCode.opt.
