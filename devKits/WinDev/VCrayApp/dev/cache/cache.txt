                     RAYAPP APPLICATION-BUILD TEMPLATE
                     =================================

   <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/blob/main/*somewhere*/cache/cache.txt>

            PROTOTYPING OF RAYLIB USAGE IN NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                         RAYAPP RAYLIB CACHE FOLDER
                         --------------------------

    The cache/ folder contains rayApp build files, a setup confirmation
    program, and compiled files of the raylib library.  The compiled files
    do not need to be recompiled unless there is a change to the setup.

    When the cache has been populated with the compiled raylib code, new
    compiles will avoid the time it takes to compile that code again.

    For more information, see ******* TBD *******.

MANIFEST

    cache.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file
    .gitignore
        excluding the compilation intermediates and supporting files from
        any git commits

    rayConfirm.c
        part of the raylib setup, used to confirm and demonstrate building
        of a raylib application using VS Build Tools and VS Code.  Once
        confirmed, rayAppBuild.bat can be adjusted to compile the user's
        raylib project files instead.

    raylibCode.opt
        Option file identifying the raylib modules to be cached.  This file
        depends on raylib\ being in a predictable location relative to the
        location of cache\.  raylib\src\rglfw.c must be the last one compiled.

    raylibVars.opt
        Preprocessor definitions for the compilation of raylib modules.

    rayLinking.opt
        Parameters for linking the compiled raylib app into an executable

    VCoptions.opt
        C Language compilation options for Visual C/C++ native compiler cl.exe
        These options are the same between cache\ and app\ compiles.  This
        file also depends on raylib\ being in the same predictable relative
        location as raylibCode.opt.

    *.obj
        Microsoft compiled C Language *.obj modules from compilation of the
        raylib files identified in raylibCode.opt.  If rglfw.obj is not
        present, the cache is considered to be incomplete or empty and all
        files specified in raylibCode.opt will be compiled.

TODO

  * Replace this when a Zip-extracted setup provides this folder and the
    additional configuration files.

  * When packaged and extracted via a VCrayApp,zip, rename as an nfoTools
    product and make the result more-seriously under .gitignore
