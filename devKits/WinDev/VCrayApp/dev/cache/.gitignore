#
#              .GITIGNORE FOR KEEPING BUILDS OUT OF A REPOSITORY
#
#   This .gitignore file is intended to exclude intermediate compilation and
#   cache *.obj materials from the git repository.  The idea is to avoid
#   tainting a clone, an install, or a VCrayApp-based project in an user's own
#   git-backed project.

#   Exclude MS Built Tools Intermediates from repositories
*.obj

#   Exclude Cache-housed executables and generated batch scripts
*.exe
*.bat
