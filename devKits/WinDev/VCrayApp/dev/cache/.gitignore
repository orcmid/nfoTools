#
#              .GITIGNORE FOR KEEPING BUILDS OUT OF A REPOSITORY
#
#   This .gitignore file is intended to exclude intermediate compilation
#   materials from the git repository.  For VCrayApp there are exclusions
#   around the transient materials produced as part of operation as well
#   as cache content that is always reconstructible by rebuilding.  None of
#   this should taint an upstream project repository, whether at nfoTools or
#   an user's own git-backed project.
