                       AN NFOTOOLS COMING ATTRACTION
                       =============================

                     CHANGES MADE FOR RAYLIB APP 0.1.0
                     ---------------------------------

    This file provides tracking of changes made to VCrayApp as part of
    developing VCrayApp 0.1.0 (beta) as the successor of VCrayApp 0.0.0
    (alpha).  These changes will also be documented in the release information
    at <https://orcmid.github.com/nfoTools/dev/D211101/D211101e/>.

    Further information on the development of VCrayApp 0.1.0 can be found
    at the GitHub project, <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/projects/11>,
    and nfoTools issues, <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/issues>.

CHANGES IN 0.1.0
****************

BREAKING: The VCrayApp.bat API has changed dramatically.  The name of the
project exe is required on the command line before the project code will be
compiled and optionally ran.  Modifications of VCrayApp.bat are no longer
required and are definitely not recommended.

IMPORTANT: With this change, VCrayApp-0.1.0 is not a simple drop-in
replacement for VCrayApp-0.0.0.  The workflow within which VCrayApp is used
must be adjusted for the changed VCrayApp.bat command prompt API,

    VCrayApp [+] ?
    VCrayApp [+] [*] [-c] [[-r] exe [src]]

Note 1: The value supplied for exe need not reflect the name of any of
the project source files; any one (and exactly one) of those files must
provide the external main() definition.  There may not be any spaces in the
chosen .exe name.  Remember to include ".exe" in the name.

Note 2: The default API src value, "src\*.c" is special.  The use of src\
for *.c and *.h files of the project is recommended.  When explicit src
parameters are supplied on the VCrayApp.bat command line, absolute filepaths
must be used, whether or not with wild cards.  There must not be any spaces
in the full-path names.

ADVANCED TECHNIQUES: Quotation of the src parameter and use of spaces in the
value will be taken as multiple src locations.  Advanced need for includes and
libraries for the standalone application should be handled by modification
of the environment variables available for that purpose under the Visual
Studio Native Command Prompt.  It may be valuable to use VCrayApp.bat from a
command script that accomplishes that, embedding the use of VCrayApp. For
examples, see <https://orcmid.github.io/dev/D211101/D211101b>.

NEW FEATURES

VCrayApp will detect and report the version of raylib and of VS Command Prompt
being used each time the cache is built.  There is checking on known recent
releases of raylib that fail with the Microsoft VC/C++ compiler.  Those won't
be used.

VCrayApp detects and reports when in-progress -dev versions of raylib are
being used, rather than recommended official releases.

VCrayApp failure messages all have FAILCODE numbers and each message has links
to details under <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/fails/>.

CHANGES-0.1.0.txt is included in the VCrayApp-0.1.0.zip file and is also one
of the release pages for consultation without downloading the full package.

Use of VCrayApp embedded in a larger project with VCrayApp.bat called from
a higher "host" script has been improved.  Environment variable VCrayAppHost
can now be set by the host to have it be accounted for by VCrayApp.  The host
can also set VCrayAppHostURL for reporting as a source of additional
information.

CHANGES

VCrayApp compiles and uses program cache\VCrayVerCheck.c every time the cache
is about to be filled.  This assists in determination of the raylib version.

VCrayApp will compile and run the cache\VCrayConfirm.c program every time the
cache of raylib code is created, providing additional confirmation that the
cache is built and operational with the version of raylib being used.

VCrayConfirm.c has been extended to report more about the VCrayApp settings
and the readiness for use of the cache with particular VC and raylib versions.

Reporting by VCrayApp is abbreviated when "+" is set for embedded-operation.
This should only be done when calling from another script that takes charge
by setting VCrayAppHost and commanding VCrayApp.  Otherwise, there is warning.

VCrayApp no longer PAUSES after a successful run, with or without execution
of any code.

VCrayApp no longer employs app\ for anything but compiling the project code.
All compiles of the VCrayApp helper programs that are part of cache\ will be
compiled into cache\ in a manner that does not interfere with use of cache\
for precompiled raylib components.

In case of problems with unpredictable results related to population of the
cache\, whether FAILCODE4 or FAILCODE5, VCrayApp will automatically attempt
to rebuild the cache on the next usage, whether requested (option "-c") or
not.

CORRECTION: When executed as embedded (option "+"), VCrayApp.bat no longer
sets LOCAL.  The caller must do so as appropriate.  This exposes variables set
by VCrayApp.bat to the host, including %VCRAYVER%, the version of raylib
determined when the cache is built as part of the VCrayApp run.  An embedded
VCrayApp does not EXIT on success, it does a :FALLOUT off the end of the
script.  On any FAILCODE, VCrayApp does force EXIT.
