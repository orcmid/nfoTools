USAGE WITH VS CODE

    When a VCrayApp project is accessed via Visual Studio Code, the Windows
    folder that contains this .vscode folder can be set as the workspace.
    VS Code will then rely on configuration properties and variables of the
    Developer Command Prompt to integrate the project with raylib and with
    the Windows SDK libraries.

    See <references to be supplied> for further details and the benefits
    of using a VS Code workspace.
