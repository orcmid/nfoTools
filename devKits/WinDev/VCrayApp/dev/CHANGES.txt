                       AN NFOTOOLS COMING ATTRACTION
                       =============================

<https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/blob/master/devKits/WinDev/VCrayApp/dev/CHANGES.txt>

                    CHANGES MADE FOR RAYLIB APP 0.1.0
                    ---------------------------------

    This file provides tracking of changes made to VCrayApp as part of
    developing VCrayApp 0.1.0 (beta) as the successor of VCrayApp 0.0.0
    (alpha).  These changes will also be documented in the release information
    at <https://orcmid.github.com/nfoTools/dev/D211101/D211101e/>.

    Further information on the development of VCrayApp 0.1.0 can be found
    at the GitHub project, <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/projects/11>,
    and nfoTools issues, <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/issues>.

CHANGES IN 0.1.0
****************

BREAKING: The VCrayApp.bat prologue settings for GAME_EXE and SRC have been
changed to VCAPPEXE and VCAPPSRC.

Note 1: The value of VCAPPEXE does not have to match the name of any of the
project source files; any one (and exactly one) of those files must provide
the external main() definition.

Note 2: VCAPPSRC value src/*.c is special.  For any different value, an
absolute filepath should be used, whether or not with wild cards.

NEW FEATURES

Environment variable VCrayAppHost can now be set to the name of a larger
application in which VCrayApp is embedded as a customized component.  This
is reflected in D211101a/ treatment of VCrayApp setup and in messages from
VCrayApp.bat.  This change can be made by modification of VCrayApp.bat or by
clearing the setting in VCrayApp.bat and setting it in a VCrayApp caller.

Environment variable VCrayAppHostURL can now be set to the location of more
details on VCrayApp messages when VCrayApp is running under a host project.
It can be introduced in the same two ways as for VCrayAppHost.  Provision of
this companion to VCrayAppHost is optional.

VCrayApp will detect and report the version of raylib and of VS Command Prompt
being used.  There is failure checking on known versions of raylib that fail
with the Microsoft VC/C++ compiler.

VCrayApp detects and reports when in-progress -dev versions of raylib are
being used.

CHANGES.txt is included in the VCrayApp-0.1.0.zip file and is also on the
release page for consultation without downloading the package.

CHANGES

NVCrayApp compiles and uses program cache\VCrayVerCheck.c every time the cache
is about to be filled.  This is used to determine the version of raylib that
is about to be used.

VCrayApp will compile and run the cache\VCrayConfirm.c program every time the
cache of raylib code is created, providing additional confirmation that the
cache is built and which version of raylib it is set with.

VCrayConfirm.c has been extended to report more about the VCrayApp settings
and the readiness for use of the cache with particular VC and raylib versions.

Reporting by VCrayApp is abbreviated when "+" is set on an embedded-operation
case and also when VCrayAppHost is set.

VCrayApp no longer PAUSES after a successful run, with or without execution
of any code.

CORRECTION: When executed as embedded (option "+"), VCrayApp.bat no longer
sets LOCAL.  The caller must do so as appropriate.  This exposes variables set
by VCrayApp.bat to the host, including %VCRAYVER%, the version of raylib
detected when the cache is built as part of the VCrayApp run.  An embedded
VCrayApp does not EXIT on success, it does a :FALLOUT off the end of the
script.  On any failure, VSrayApp does force EXIT.
