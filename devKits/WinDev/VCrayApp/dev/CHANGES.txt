                    CHANGES MADE FOR RAYLIB APP 0.1.0
                    ---------------------------------

    This file provides tracking of changes made to VCrayApp as part of
    developing VCrayApp 0.1.0 (beta) as the successor of VCrayApp 0.0.0
    (alpha).  These changes will also be documented in the release information
    at <https://orcmid.github.com/nfoTools/dev/D211101/D211101e/>.

    Further information on the development of VCrayApp 0.1.0 can be found
    at the GitHub project, <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/projects/11>,
    and nfoTools issues, <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/issues>.

CHANGES IN 0.1.0

BREAKING: The VCrayApp.bat prologue settings for GAME_EXE and SRC have been
changed to VCAPPEXE and VCAPPSRC.

Environment variable GAME_EXE is no longer used.  Variable VCAPPEXE is now
used. This does not have to match the name of any of the project source files;
any one (and only one) of those files can provide main().

Environment variable SRC is no longer used.  Variable VCAPPSRC is used
instead.  The use of src/*.c is special.  For any different value, an
absolution filepath should be used, whether or not with wild cards.

Environment variable VCrayAppHost can now be set to the name of a larger
application in which VCrayApp is embedded as a customized component.  This
is reflected in D211101a/ treatment of VCrayApp setup and in messages from
VCrayApp.bat.

Environment variable VCrayAppHostURL can now be set to the location of more
details on VCrayApp messages when VCrayApp is running under a host project.

VCrayApp will detect and report the version of raylib and of VS Command Prompt
being used.  There is failure checking on versions of raylib that fail with
the Microsoft VC/C++ compiler.

VCrayApp will detect when in-progress -dev versions of raylib are being used.

VCrayApp will compile and run the cache\VCrayConfirm.c program every time the
cache of raylib code is created, providing additional confirmation that the
cache is built and which version of raylib it is set with.

VCrayConfirm.c has been extended to report more about the VCrayApp settings
and the readiness for use of the cache with particular VC and raylib versions.
