                       =============================

<https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/blob/master/devKits/WinDev/VCrayApp/dev/CHANGES.txt>

                    CHANGES MADE FOR RAYLIB APP 0.1.0
                    ---------------------------------

    This file provides tracking of changes made to VCrayApp as part of
    developing VCrayApp 0.1.0 (beta) as the successor of VCrayApp 0.0.0
    (alpha).  These changes will also be documented in the release information
    at <https://orcmid.github.com/nfoTools/dev/D211101/D211101e/>.

    Further information on the development of VCrayApp 0.1.0 can be found
    at the GitHub project, <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/projects/11>,
    and nfoTools issues, <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/issues>.

**CHANGES-ENUMERATION GOES HERE**

FAIL5 now identifies which program failed to compile or run properly as
part of VCrayApp operation.

Environment variable VCrayAppHost can now be set to the name of a larger
application in which VCrayApp is embedded as a customized component.  This
is reflected in D211101a/ treatment of VCrayApp setup and in messages from
VCrayApp.bat.

Environment variable VCrayAppHostURL can now be set to the location of more
details on VCrayApp messages when VCrayApp is running under a host project.

VCrayApp will detect and report the version of raylib and of VS Command Prompt
being used.  There is failure checking on versions of raylib that fail with
the Microsoft VC/C++ compiler.

VCrayApp will detect when in-progress -dev versions of raylib are being used.

VCrayApp will compile and run the cache\VCrayConfirm.c program every time the
cache of raylib code is created, providing additional confirmation that the
cache is built and which version of raylib it is set with.

Environment variable GAME_EXE is no longer used.  Variable APP_EXE is now
used. This does not have to match the name of any of the project source files;
any one (and only one) of those files can provide main().
