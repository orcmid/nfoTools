                    RAYAPP APPLICATION-BUILD TEMPLATE
                     =================================

            VCRAYAPP.ZIP TEMPLATE FOR RAYLIB NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                         RAYAPP XCOPY/MSIX APP FOLDER
                         ----------------------------

    app/ is the standard VCrayApp subfolder for a command-line build of a
    raylib project's executable program.  app/ receives the compiled .exe and
    any accompanying files/folders that must be adjacent to the executable.

    The app/ folder content is amenable to delivery in a Zip file after some
    tidying.  Addition of a README and other user-supporting materials is
    useful.

    Further details are at <**Location to be provided**>

MANIFEST

    app.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file (not deliverable, customizable)
    .gitignore
        excluding some rayApp.zip material and compilation results from
        any Git so that modifications here are entirely local.
        (not deliverable, possibly customized or removed)

    resources/
        here when provided as a neighbor of the compiled .exe file and
        included in the app package (a typical raylib deliverable)

    *.exe
        here as the compiled product (deliverable)

    *.obj
        files that are only transient here and not part of the app package
        (not deliverable, usually remaining only if a compile fails)

    other materials are provided as the project requires.
