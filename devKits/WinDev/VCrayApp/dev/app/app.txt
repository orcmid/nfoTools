  *                                                                       *
  *          DO NOT REMOVE THIS FILE. VCRAYAPP.BAT REQUIRES ONE           *

  *                                                                       *
  *    app\ is the standard VCrayApp subfolder into which a project's     *
  *    .exe executable code is compiled.  app\ is also the location for   *
  *    accompanying files/folders that must be adjacent to the .exe       *
  *    for correct operation.                                             *
  *                                                                       *
  *    app\ folder content is amenable to delivery in a Zip file after    *
  *    copying to a separate location, removal of extraneous material     *
  *    (such as this file) there, and addition of supporting content      *
  *    needed for the deployed result. The typical case is demonstrated   *
  *    at <*** link to be provided ***>                                   *
  *                                                                       *
  *    The deployed folder can also be employed for derived materials     *
  *    of the running application including user information and saved    *
  *    history/state.  It is recommended that there be a means for the    *
  *    confirmation of correct installation and also accepting updates.   *
  *                                                                       *
  *    Further details are at <**Location to be provided**>. For more     *
  *    information see <***link to be provided***>.                       *
  *                                                                       *
  *    If VCrayApp is re-extracted or is updated and extracted, this      *
  *    file and the .gitignore will be restored/replaced.  Any other      *
  *    files already in this folder will be untouched.                    *                                          *
  *                                                                       *

MANIFEST

    app.txt
        this synopsis and manifest (customizable, not usually deployed)

    .gitignore
        excluding some VCrayApp app\ and compilation results from
        any Git so that modifications here are entirely local.
        (possibly customized or removed, not usually deployed with the app)

    resources/
        here when provided as a neighbor of the compiled .exe file and
        included in the app package (the typical raylib technique)

    *.exe
        here as the compiled product (deliverable)

    *.obj
        files that are only transient here and not part of the app package
        (not to be deployed, usually remaining only if a compile fails)

    other materials are provided as an individual project requires.
