                    COMPILED RAYAPP APPLICATION FOLDER
                    ==================================

             RAYAPP.ZIP TEMPLATE FOR RAYLIB NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                         RAYAPP XCOPY/MSIX APP FOLDER
                         ----------------------------

    The app/ folder is a standard subfolder for a command-line build in the
    parent folder.  app/ receives the compiled .exe and any accompanying
    files/folders that are required to be adjacent to the executable program.

    The folder is amenable to XCopy deployment and potential use in creating
    an MSIX distributable.  The app/ folder content is amenable to delivery in
    a Zip file as well, generally after removing some scaffolding.  Addition
    of a README and other user-supporting materials would be handy.

MANIFEST

    app.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file (not deliverable, customizable)
    .gitignore
        excluding some rayApp.zip material and compilation results from
        any Git so that modifications here are entirely local.
        (not deliverable, possibly customized or removed)

    resources/
        here when provided as a neighbor of the compiled .exe file and
        included in the app package (deliverable)

    *.exe
        here as the compiled product (deliverable)

    *.obj
        files that are only transient here and not part of the app package
        (not deliverable, usually remaining only if a compile fails)

  * Add a NOTICE.txt that acknowledges development and construction.

  * That means need a LICENSE.txt file too.

  * Any further morphing depends on the final refactoring for inclusion in
    any VCrayApp.zip
