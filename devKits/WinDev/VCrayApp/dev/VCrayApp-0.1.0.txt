           BUILDING RAYLIB APPS WITH VS DEVELOPER COMMAND PROMPT
           -----------------------------------------------------

  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
  *                                                                     *
  *                              CAUTION                                *
  *                              *******                                *
  *                                                                     *
  *    This is a beta release of VCrayApp.  The release is intended     *
  *    as a preview of the stable release to follow once there has been *
  *    a period of testing and review with feedback from trial use.     *
  *                                                                     *
  *    There could still be breaking changes, possibly to adjust for    *
  *    changes in raylib and other tools that occur in the interim.     *
  *                                                                     *
  *    Be cautious.  Be careful.  It is recommended that VCrayApp be    *
  *    used solely with official stable releases of raylib and other    *
  *    tools.  Use of development versions of raylib\ and other tools   *
  *    is recommended only for those interested in working on raylib\   *
  *   itself, sustaining its usefulness.                                *
  *                                                                     *
  *                             IMPORTANT                               *
  *                             *********                               *
  *                                                                     *
  *    No VCrayApp support is provided for development using anything   *
  *    but the C language and the Microsoft VC C/C++ compiler and       *
  *    related developer tools on a Windows desktop PC, laptop or       *
  *    Microsoft Surface.                                               *
  *                                                                     *
  *    VCRAYAPP 0.1.0 IS BEING TESTED WITH THE RAYLIB 4.0.0 SOURCE      *
  *    CODE.  RAYLIB 4.2.0 CANNOT BE USED BECAUSE OF A VC/C++           *
  *    INCOMPATIBILITY.  VCRAYAPP 0.1.0 CAN ALSO BE USED WITH 3.7.0.    *
  *    CONFIRMATION WITH LATER RAYLIB RELEASES IS FUTURE WORK.          *
  *                                                                     *                                                                     *
  *    Ramon Santiago's raylib software is written in a clean-form of   *
  *    the C Language (C11 standard).  Use of the raylib code, include  *
  *    files, and the API interfaces requires confidence in the use of  *
  *    the C or C++ languages with such libraries. VCrayApp is intended *
  *    to be used directly only for programs written in the C Language. *
  *                                                                     *
  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    The VCrayApp-0.1.0 distribution is available on the web at
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/D211101e>.  Consult
    that page for the latest status, links to useful related material,
    and any more-recent version.  If there is concern for the authenticity
    or correctness of any VCrayApp distribution, obtain a full replacement
    via <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101>.

    VCrayApp is designed to work with versions of Visual Studio that are free
    for personal/open-source use, including the Visual Studio Build Tools
    (recommended) and the Visual Studio Community editions.  Additional levels
    of licensed Visual Studio can also be used, all via their Native Tools
    Command Prompt.

 PREREQUISITES AND DEPENDENCIES

    Development with VCrayApp and illustration of usage involves the following
    tools along with confident use of C Language:

     * Windows File Explorer
     * Windows Built-in Zip-Folder Tool
     * Visual Studio Native Build Tools
     * Developer Command Prompt
     * Microsoft VC/C++ Command Line Compiler, CL.exe
     * raylib *source* code *release* 4.0.0 (or 3.7.0) downloaded and unzipped
     * A text-editor for work on source code, other files, all in plain text
       (Visual Studio Code recommended for its C/C++ and Microsoft support)
     + Git4Win implementation for source-code control
     + TortoiseGit for File Explorer integration of Git
     + GitHub Windows Client for public access to development projects
     + GPG4Win for creation and verification of digital signatures

    The first seven are essential.  The remainder are recommended; those are
    not required for starting up.  There are alternatives.  The specific ones
    happen to be those relied upon in the development of nfoTools projects.
    For more information on dependencies, see
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101>.

DOWNLOADS AND SETUP

    It is recommended that you have already installed Visual Studio Native
    Build Tools and confirmed that the Developer Command Prompt is operating
    properly.  See <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T211002/>.

    If you have not already done so, choose where on your computer you want
    to have the raylib source code and your own adjacent projects.  See
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T211101/> and also the setup
    arrangement described at <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101>
    and <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/D211101a>.

    raylib\ must be setup before VCrayApp can be used.

    Download VCrayApp from
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/D211101e>.
    If a later version is available, consider using that version instead.

    It is useful to download VCrayApp-0.1.0.zip to a location that you can
    use as a source of copies for one or more VCrayApp projects.

EXTRACTION AND RENAMING OF VCrayApp-0.1.0.zip CONTENT

    After downloading VCrayApp-0.1.0.zip to a place where you want to keep
    it, make a copy to a place where you want to use it.

    Right click on File Explorer VCrayApp-0.1.0.zip and click
    "Extract all ..." in the context menu that appears.

    In the "Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders" Dialog that appears,
    accept the "Files will be extracted to this folder:" choice that is
    offered automatically.

    Check the "Show extracted files when complete" entry.

    Click "Extract".

    There should now be a VCrayApp-0.1.0\ sub-folder in the same folder as the
    Zip file you extracted.  Rename that sub-folder to the name you want for
    this VCrayApp project of yours.  This is your project folder.


 CONFIRMING THE VCrayApp SETUP AND OPERATION

    Using a Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt, navigate to your project
    folder and use the command

        VCrayApp ?

    To confirm that the project folder is setup properly and that VCrayApp.bat
    is operating.

    If that succeeds, use the command

        VCrayApp -r

    This will compile raylib components to the cache\ folder, compile a sample
    program to the app\ folder, and then operate that program.

    If there are any failure messages, correct for them until this command
    succeeds.  See <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101> for
    additional information.

    Use your text editor to modify VCrayApp.bat for your own project instead
    of the sample.  Only two changes are required, as specified in that file.
