                     =================================

            VCRAYAPP.ZIP TEMPLATE FOR RAYLIB NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                           RECOMMENDED SRC FOLDER
                           ----------------------

    The src/ subfolder is provided as a subfolder of the expanded and renamed
    VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip.  It is standard practice no matter how many source
    files there are for the project.

    Typically, there will be at least one *.c file and possible *.h files.

    The use of this src/ subfolder for VCrayApp-format projects is described
    at <***nfoTools location TBD***>.

   <***nfoTools location TBD***>

 * First, confirm the rayApp setup by performing a successful rayConfirm.exe
   compilation, making any corrections that are required.

 * Then switch to your project by changing the two SET commands as specified
   in the beginning of rayApp.bat.
