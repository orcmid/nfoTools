                     RAYAPP APPLICATION-BUILD TEMPLATE
                     =================================

            VCRAYAPP.ZIP TEMPLATE FOR RAYLIB NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                           RECOMMENDED SRC FOLDER
                           ----------------------

    The use of a src/ subfolder is recommended for projects based on a
    VCrayApp.zip template.  Typically there will be at least one *.c file
    and possible *.h files that share definitions among them.

TODO

 * Review the tutorial information on using VCrayApp.zip provided at **TBD**

 * First confirm the rayApp setup by performing a successful rayApp.bat
   operation, satisfying all of the setup conditions that are reported.

 * To then work with the project source files created here, customize
   rayApp.bat line 21 to be "SET SRC=src\*.c"
