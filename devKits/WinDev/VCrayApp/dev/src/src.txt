  *    This src\ folder is recommended for creation of the application    *
  *    *.c and *.h code files.  There should be exactly one *.c file      *
  *    containing a main() function.  Provide additional *.c and *.h      *
  *    as desired for the program's modular organization.  For more       *
  *    information see <***link to be provided***>.                       *
  *                                                                       *
  *    Although this folder is required, it does not have to be used.     *
  *    When this folder is used for the raylib application source code    *
  *    there are advantages in the use of Visual Studio Code for the      *
  *    project. See <***another link to be provided***>.                  *                                                          *
  *                                                                       *
  *    It is recommended that the source code here be backed-up under     *
  *    a source-code management system such as Git and GitHub.  See       *
  *    <***yet another link***>.                                          *
  *                                                                       *
  *    DO NOT COMPILE INTO THIS FOLDER.  SEE THE DESCRIPTION FOR THIS     *
  *    VCrayApp RELEASE (I.E, THE VCrayApp-0.1.0.txt FILE) and further    *
  *    information at <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101>.    *                                                     *
  *                                                                       *
  *    If VCrayApp is re-extracted or is updated and extracted, this      *
  *    file will be restored/replaced.  Any other files already in this   *
  *    folder will be untouched.                                          *
  *                                                                       *
