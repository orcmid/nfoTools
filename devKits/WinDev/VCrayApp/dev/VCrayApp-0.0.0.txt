  *                              CAUTION                                *
  *                              *******                                *

  *    This is an alpha release of VCrayApp.  There is incomplete       *
  *    information.  Alpha is intended for review and testing of the    *
  *    functionality.  It requires more self-reliance than expected     *
  *    of novice developers.  The purpose is gathering feedback from    *
  *    trial use.  There will be beta releases followed by stable       *
  *    releases.  There may be breaking changes in that progression.    *
  *    Be cautious.  Be careful.  Here be dragons.                      *
  *                                                                     *
  *                             IMPORTANT                               *
  *                             *********                               *
  *                                                                     *
  *    No VCrayApp support is provided for development using anything   *
  *    but the C language  and the Microsoft VC C/C++ compiler and      *
  *    related developer tools on a Windows PC, desktop or laptop.      *
  *                                                                     *
  *    VCRAYAPP 0.0.0 IS BEING TESTED WITH THE RAYLIB 3.7.0 SOURCE      *
  *    CODE.  THERE ARE POSSIBLE DIFFICULTIES WITH RAYLIB 4.0.0 BECAUSE *
  *    OF BREAKING CHANGES IN THAT RELEASE AND SUBSEQUENT ACTIVITY.     *
  *    CONFIRMATION WITH 4.0.0 AND LATER RELEASES IS FUTURE WORK.       *
  *                                                                     *                                                                     *
  *    Ramon Santiago's raylib software is written in a clean-form of   *
  *    the C Language.  Use of the raylib code, include files, and the  *
  *    API interfaces requires confidence in the use of the C or C++    *
  *    languages with such libraries. VCrayApp is intended to be used   *
  *    directly only for programs written in the C Language.            *
  *                                                                     *
  * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    The VCrayApp-0.0.0 distribution is available on the web at
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/D211101c>.  Consult
    that page for the latest status, links to useful related material,
    and the most-recent version.  If there is concern for the authenticity
    or correctness of any VCrayApp distribution, obtain a full replacement
    via <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101>.

    VCrayApp is designed to work with versions of Visual Studio that are free
    for personal use, including the Visual Studio Build Tools (recommended)
    and the Visual Studio Community editions.  Additional levels of Visual
    Studio can also be used, all via their Native Tools Command Prompt.

 PREREQUISITES AND DEPENDENCIES

    Development with VCrayApp and illustration of usage involves the following
    tools along with confident use of C Language:

     * Windows File Explorer
     * Windows Built-in Zip-Folder Tool
     * Visual Studio Native Build Tools
     * Developer Command Prompt
     * Microsoft VC/C++ Command Line Compiler, CL.exe
     * raylib *source* code *release* downloaded and installed
     * A text-editor for work on source code, other files, all in plain text
       (Visual Studio Code recommended for its C/C++ and Microsoft support)
     + Git4Win implementation for source-code control
     + TortoiseGit for File Explorer integration of Git
     + GitHub Windows Client for public access to development projects
     + GPG4Win for creation and verification of digital signatures

    The first seven are essential.  The remainder are recommended.  They are
    not required to get started.  For more information on dependencies, see
    <https://orcmid.github.io/dev/D211101>.

DOWNLOADS AND SETUP

    It is recommended that you have already installed Visual Studio Native
    Build Tools and confirmed that the Developer Command Prompt is operating
    properly.  See <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T211002/>.

    If you have not already done so, choose where on your computer you want
    to have the raylib source code and your own adjacent projects.  See
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T211101/> and also the setup
    arrangement described at <https://orcmid.github.io/dev/D211101> and
    <https://orcmid.github.io/dev/D211101/D211101a>.

    raylib\ must be setup before VCrayApp can be used.

    Download VCrayApp from <https://orcmid.github.io/dev/D211101/D211101c>.
    If a later version is available, obtain that version.

    It is useful to download VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip to a location that you can
    use as a source of copies for one or more VCrayApp projects.

 EXTRACTION AND RENAMING OF VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip CONTENT

    After downloading VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip to a place where you want to keep
    it, make a copy to a place where you want to use it.

    Right click on File Explorer VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip and click
    "Extract all ..." in the context menu that appears.

    In the "Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders" Dialog that appears,
    accept the "Files will be extracted to this folder:" choice that is
    offered automatically.

    Check the "Show extracted files when complete" entry.

    Click "Extract".

    There should now be a VCrayApp-0.0.0\ folder in the same folder as the
    Zip file you extracted.  Rename that folder to the name you want for this
    VCrayApp project.


 CONFIRMING THE VCrayApp SETUP AND OPERATION

    Using a Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt, navigate to your project
    folder and use the command

        VCrayApp ?

    To confirm that the project folder is setup properly and that VCrayApp.bat
    is operating.

    If that succeeds, use the command

        VCrayApp -r

    To compile raylib components to the cache\ folder, compile a sample
    program to the app\ folder, and then operate that program.

    If there are any failure messages, correct for them until this command
    succeeds.  See <https://orcmid.github.io/dev/D211101> for additional
    information.

    Use your text editor to modify VCrayApp.bat for your own project instead
    of the sample.  Only two changes are required, as specified in the file.
