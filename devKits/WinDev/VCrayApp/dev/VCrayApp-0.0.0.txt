 1. OVERVIEW

    VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip delivers a Windows folder and batch script for setting
    up development of Windows native graphical applications. The raylib of
    Ramon Santiago is used <https://www.raylib.com/>.  VCrayApp is useful for
    development of self-contained computer games and similar applications.

    VCrayApp provides compilation of raylib apps using the Microsoft Visual
    C/C++ command-line compiler, CL.exe, along with other freely-available
    developer tools, including others from Microsoft.

    If VCrayApp is found incorporated in a larger project, check for any
    custom instructions that apply to specific usage in that project.

    The expected setup of VCrayApp is with the following folder structure:

        your-development-files-location\
         |- raylib\                 // folder where raylib source is extracted
         :  ...
         |- VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip      // at the same level, same drive
         |- your-extracted-VCrayApp-0.0.0-folder-renamed\
             |- .vscode\            // suggested .vscode settings
             |- app\                // folder where you App is compiled to
             |- cache\              // folder for working files and VCrayApp
             |                      // materials
             |- src\                // optional default location for your
             |                      // source files
             |- VCrayApp.bat        // the batch script for compiling your app
             |- VCrayApp-0.0.0.txt  // this file

    There are explanatory materials and other files in the four sub-folders.

    The VCrayApp.bat file is initially set to compile a sample program that
    is incorporated in the cache\ folder.  After installation and operation
    is confirmed, VCrayApp.bat must be modified to specify the name for your
    application and the location of your source files.  No other modifications
    are required.

    Performing command "VCrayApp ?" will provide usage information.

       USAGE: VCrayApp [+] ?
              VCrayApp [+] [*] [-c] [-r]
       where  ? produces this usage information.
              + for operating non-stop without any screen clearing
                and pausing.  Good for use called as a helper.
              * selects terse output.  If operation fails, repeat
                without this option for more details.
             -c for a complete rebuild of any cache
             -r for running the app on successful build

        Exit code 0 is produced on all successful operations.
        Exit codes greater than 1 are produced for any failure.

    A successful compile will provide an executable in the app\ subfolder
    for operation along with whatever assets have been placed there.  It is
    possible to deploy a successfully-built application from app\.


 2. PREREQUISITES AND DEPENDENCIES

    It is assumed that Microsoft Windows 7 Professional or later are used.
    Thorough VCrayApp testing is with Microsoft Windows 10 latest versions.

    Development with VCrayApp and illustration of usage involves the following
    tools:

     * Windows File Explorer
     * Windows Built-in Zip-Folder Tool
     * Visual Studio Native Build Tools
     * Developer Command Prompt
     * VC/C++ Command Line Compiler, CL.exe
     * Visual Studio Code for editing of source code, other files, and
       confirmation of library integration
     * Git4Win implementation for source-code control
     * TortoiseGit for File Explorer integration of Git
     * GitHub Windows Client for public access to development projects
     * GPG4Win for creation and verification of digital signatures

    The first five are essential.  The remainder are recommended.  No nfoTools
    support is provided for use of alternatives.  For further details on
    dependencies, see <pending-location>.

    To use VCrayApp, you will need to use the Windows File Explorer, to
    navigate and operate with the Windows Command Shell, cmd.exe, and to
    operate with Windows Batch (.bat) script files.

    VCrayApp is designed to work with versions of Visual Studio that are free
    for personal use, including the Visual Studio Build Tools (recommended)
    and the Visual Studio Community editions.  Additional levels of Visual
    Studio can also be used, all via there Native Tools Command Prompt.  No
    use is made of Visual Studio projects, solutions, and the conventional
    separation of debug and release builds.  With nfoTools, emphasis is on
    testing and confirmation of what is shipped: only release-build stages.

 3. INITIAL SETUP



 3. EXTRACTION AND RENAMING OF VCrayApp-0.0.0.zip CONTENT



    After downloading VCrayApp-0.0.zip,

    In the Windows File Explorer, locate the copy of VCbind.zip that you
    intend to use.

    Right click on the entry for VCbind.zip and click "Extract all ..." in
    the context menu that appears.

    In the "Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders" Dialog that appears,
    do not change the "Files will be extracted to this folder:" choice that
    is offered automatically.  This is important in order for other components
    of a construction set to find the VCbind content correctly.

    Check the "Show extracted files when complete" entry.

    Click "Extract".

    If a "Replace or Skip Files" dialog appears, click "Replace the files
    in the destination" option.  This will impose the files from VCbind 0.1.0
    without disturbing any non-VCbind files you may have added.

    There should now be a VCbind\ folder in the same folder as the VCbind.zip.
    In that folder you will see that the the files listed in the Manifest at
    the end of the VCbind-0.1.0.txt file are included.


 4. USING THE VCBIND\VCBIND.BAT SCRIPT

    Confirm that everything is working by double-clicking on the VCbind.bat
    file in the folder VCbind.zip is extracted into.  There should be a simple
    success report.  If there is a failure report, provide any remedy that is
    indicated.

    To use VCbind as part of a construction set, start a Windows Command Shell
    (cmd.exe) session.  Navigate to where you want to be using the VC compiler
    and environment.  This can be in the VCbind\ folder that has the VCbind.bat
    file, or it can be from some other folder where you will be working.

    To learn about VCbind options, use the command form

            VCbind.bat ?

    The simplest use of VCbind within a console session is by plain command

            VCbind.bat

    providing a default environment using the latest-version of VC compiler
    that is detected.

    On a successful report from VCbind.bat, confirm presence of the compiler
    with the command

             CL.exe

    in the same session.  Use "CL.exe /?" for extensive information about
    compiler options.

    Detailed use of the VC compiler and other command-line development tools
    will depend on the nature of the construction set in which VCbind is
    found.  Consult the further instructions that are provided.


 5. DEVELOPER USE OF VCBIND.ZIP

    Add VCbind.zip to personal construction sets for command-line operation
    with Visual C/C++ compilers, libraries, and tools environments.

    Investigate <http://nfoWare.com/2016/11/d161102.htm> for VCbinder tips
    on incorporation in yout own distributed construction sets.

    The source-code for the VCbind 0.1.0 release is also available at the
    <http://nfoWare.com/2016/11/d161101c.htm> page.

    The public source-code management system where VCbind 0.1.0 was developed
    is <https://github.com/orcmid/Adv10> at dev/VCbinder/devBind/
