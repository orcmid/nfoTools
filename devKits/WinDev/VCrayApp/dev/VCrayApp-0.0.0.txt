 1. OVERVIEW

    VCbind.zip delivers a Windows batch script for setting up a command-
    line environment.  The resulting environment enables compiling with the
    Microsoft Visual C/C++ command-line compiler, cl.exe, aud using related
    Microsoft developer tools.

    VCbind.zip is found as a component of larger construction sets.  Check
    for custom instructions that apply to extraction and usage of VCbind
    in a particular construction set.

    Ordinarily, construction sets using VCbind version 0.1.0 have a copy
    of this file, VCbind-0.1.0.txt, alongside the VCbind.zip file.  Use
    the version included in VCbind.zip if it is different.

    Extract VCbind.zip at the location where it appears in a construction set.
    The result is a companion folder with the following structure.

               construction-set-location\
                  ...
                  VCbind.zip    *location in the construction set
                  VCbind\       *created by extraction
                     ...
                     Vcbind-0.1.0.txt
                     VCbind.bat
                  ...

    The VCbind\ folder is not part of the preserved construction set.
    Customize it freely and leave the construction-set code intact.  Recover
    VCbind\ to its released construction-set form by re-extracting from
    VCbind.zip.


 2. PREREQUISITES AND DEPENDENCIES

    To use VCbind, you will need to use the Windows File Explorer, be able to
    initiate Windows Batch files, and to navigate and operate with the Windows
    Command Shell, cmd.exe.

    VCbind is designed to work with versions of Visual Studio that are free
    for personal use, from Visual Studio C++ Express 2008 to Visual Studio
    C++ Express 2015.

    Use the C/C++ desktop-development options of the free Visual Studio 2015
    Community Edition for open-source work with the Visual Studio Integrated
    Development Environment (IDE).  If you only want Microsoft command-line
    developer tools without the Visual Studio IDE, use the Visual Studio
    2015 or 2013 Build Tools downloads instead.

    It is assumed that Microsoft Windows 7 Professional or later are used.
    Thorough VCbind testing is with Microsoft Windows 10 Pro latest versions
    starting with Anniversary Edition version 1607.


 3. EXTRACTION OF VCBIND.ZIP CONTENT

    In the Windows File Explorer, locate the copy of VCbind.zip that you
    intend to use.

    Right click on the entry for VCbind.zip and click "Extract all ..." in
    the context menu that appears.

    In the "Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders" Dialog that appears,
    do not change the "Files will be extracted to this folder:" choice that
    is offered automatically.  This is important in order for other components
    of a construction set to find the VCbind content correctly.

    Check the "Show extracted files when complete" entry.

    Click "Extract".

    If a "Replace or Skip Files" dialog appears, click "Replace the files
    in the destination" option.  This will impose the files from VCbind 0.1.0
    without disturbing any non-VCbind files you may have added.

    There should now be a VCbind\ folder in the same folder as the VCbind.zip.
    In that folder you will see that the the files listed in the Manifest at
    the end of the VCbind-0.1.0.txt file are included.


 4. USING THE VCBIND\VCBIND.BAT SCRIPT

    Confirm that everything is working by double-clicking on the VCbind.bat
    file in the folder VCbind.zip is extracted into.  There should be a simple
    success report.  If there is a failure report, provide any remedy that is
    indicated.

    To use VCbind as part of a construction set, start a Windows Command Shell
    (cmd.exe) session.  Navigate to where you want to be using the VC compiler
    and environment.  This can be in the VCbind\ folder that has the VCbind.bat
    file, or it can be from some other folder where you will be working.

    To learn about VCbind options, use the command form

            VCbind.bat ?

    The simplest use of VCbind within a console session is by plain command

            VCbind.bat

    providing a default environment using the latest-version of VC compiler
    that is detected.

    On a successful report from VCbind.bat, confirm presence of the compiler
    with the command

             CL.exe

    in the same session.  Use "CL.exe /?" for extensive information about
    compiler options.

    Detailed use of the VC compiler and other command-line development tools
    will depend on the nature of the construction set in which VCbind is
    found.  Consult the further instructions that are provided.


 5. DEVELOPER USE OF VCBIND.ZIP

    Add VCbind.zip to personal construction sets for command-line operation
    with Visual C/C++ compilers, libraries, and tools environments.

    Investigate <http://nfoWare.com/2016/11/d161102.htm> for VCbinder tips
    on incorporation in yout own distributed construction sets.

    The source-code for the VCbind 0.1.0 release is also available at the
    <http://nfoWare.com/2016/11/d161101c.htm> page.

    The public source-code management system where VCbind 0.1.0 was developed
    is <https://github.com/orcmid/Adv10> at dev/VCbinder/devBind/
