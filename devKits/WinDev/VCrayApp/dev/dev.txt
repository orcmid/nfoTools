 ATTRIBUTION

   Hamilton, Dennis E. raylib App Build with VS Developer Command Prompt.
   nfoTools text file version 0.0.7 dated 2023-01-16, available on the
   Internet as a version of
   <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/blob/master/devKits/WinDev/VCrayApp/dev/dev.txt>

TODO

 * Work toward VCrayApp 1.0.0 after 0.1.x beta(s)

 * Add links to more and better information in the rayConfirm.c file.
   Replace place-holder <...> items with valid links.

  * Include a link on signature and hash checking in the manifest.  Also
   provide something more on the documentation for such things.

 * Update the materials for preparation of VCrayApp 0.1.0 (beta).

 * If for any reason, there needs to be a VCrayApp 0.0.1 or further, that
   can be developed on a separate branch using the VCrayApp\ artifacts that
   will be untouched there.  That needs to be mentioned on the checklist and
   also VCrayApp.txt.

 * There should probably be a good use of branching to handle the different
   cases.  Don't want to branch all of nfoTools though.

 * In app.txt there are 3 place-holders for fill-in by the time of 0.1.0
   release.  Beta must be a release candidate with 1.0.0 after any fixes
   and responses to problems and suggestions.

 * In .vscode.txt there is a link place-holder.  This should be dealt with
   by the time of VCrayApp 0.1.0 release.

 * Ensure that there is a check for raylib\ presence in VCrayApp.bat

 * In the VSrayApp-*semver*.txt, ensure that there are not consecutive "--..."
   at the beginning of ruler lines, so that armor signatures do not substitute
   spaces among them.  There needs to be something that extraction won't alter
   as well.  Put a "*" in place of the first "-"
