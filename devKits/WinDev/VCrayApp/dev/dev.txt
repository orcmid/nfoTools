 ATTRIBUTION

   Hamilton, Dennis E. raylib App Build with VS Developer Command Prompt.
   nfoTools text file version 0.0.19 dated 2023-02-23, available on the
   Internet as a version of
   <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/blob/master/devKits/WinDev/VCrayApp/dev/dev.txt>

TODO

 * Work toward VCrayApp 1.0.0 after 0.1.x beta(s)

 * Add links to more and better information in the VCrayConfirm.c file.
   Replace place-holder <...> items with valid links.

  * Include a link on signature and hash checking in the manifest.  Also
   provide something more on the documentation for such things.

 * Update the materials for preparation of VCrayApp 0.1.0 (beta).

 * If for any reason, there needs to be a VCrayApp 0.1.1 or further, that
   can be developed on a separate branch using the VCrayApp\ artifacts that
   will be untouched there.  That needs to be mentioned on the checklist and
   also VCrayApp.txt.

 * There should probably be a good use of branching to handle the different
   cases.  Don't want to branch all of nfoTools though.

 * In app.txt there are 3 place-holders for fill-in by the time of 0.1.0
   release.  Beta must be the preview of the release candidate for 1.0.0 after
   any fixes and responses to problems and suggestions.

 * In .vscode.txt there is a link place-holder.  This should be dealt with
   by the time of VCrayApp 0.1.0 release.

 * Use RAYLIB_VERSION defined in raylib.h starting with "4.0".  This should be
   reflected in the VCrayConfirm.c output.  We can use VC information also, to
   indicate any assumptions that apply when VCrayApp is used.

 * There might also be a compatibility check at compile time if the version
   detected in compiling rayConfirm is incompatible with the cache.  Things
   are brittle around this and we need to be careful in the case of an user
   source-code where there is no check and a version incompatibility comes up
   because the cache is stale.  There needs to be some precaution that must be
   made known somehow.

 * Adjust VCrayApp.bat to do the following when a new cache is to be built.

   7. If there is a "*-dev" VCRAYVER, we will warn about use for a release
      in VCrayConfirm.c and proceed.
   8. We don't know about releases after 4.2 at this time.  We will attempt
      to proceed and see what happens.  We may need to test with 4.5-dev
      in order to be prepared.

 * Location of "..\..\raylib" in the script creates a lot of dependencies
   on raylib location in VCrayApp.bat.  It would be nice to reduce those.
   The brittleness of that and raylibCode.opt is troubling.

 * It would be nice if there was a way to recompile VCrayConfirm.c without
   messing up any user development.  This would change the customization
   needed for switching to the users's source.  Just don't make things more
   brittle than they are already.  That is, we would have src\ as the default
   but how do we distinguish first run from later?

 * VCrayConfirm.c can use getenv() to grab VCRAYVER and other vars also.

 * see if VCrayconfirm.c can be made %SRC% temporarily, then restore %SRC%
   that has been set by modification of VCrayApp.bat.

 * Because of EXIT cases, we cannot re-use the compilation code for SRC
   in compiling VCrayConfirm.c.  We will duplicate the necessary code as
   part of the cache-compilation case.  \app will be reused and that should
   be fine.

 * Modify rayConfirm.c to have a smaller display.
    5. Check if a raylib "-dev" version and caution if so.

 * Test VCrayApp 0.1.0 (beta) with raylib 4.5-dev
