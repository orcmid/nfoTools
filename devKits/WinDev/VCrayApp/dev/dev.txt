TODO

 * Work toward VCrayApp 1.0.0 after 0.1.x beta(s)

 * Add links to more and better information in the rayConfirm.c file.
   Replace place-holder <...> items with valid links.

  * Include a link on signature and hash checking in the manifest.  Also
   provide something more on the documentation for such things.

 * Update the materials for preparation of VCrayApp 0.1.0 (beta).

 * If for any reason, there needs to be a VCrayApp 0.1.1 or further, that
   can be developed on a separate branch using the VCrayApp\ artifacts that
   will be untouched there.  That needs to be mentioned on the checklist and
   also VCrayApp.txt.

 * There should probably be a good use of branching to handle the different
   cases.  Don't want to branch all of nfoTools though.

 * In app.txt there are 3 place-holders for fill-in by the time of 0.1.0
   release.  Beta must be the preview of the release candidate for 1.0.0 after
   any fixes and responses to problems and suggestions.

 * In .vscode.txt there is a link place-holder.  This should be dealt with
   by the time of VCrayApp 0.1.0 release.

 * Use RAYLIB_VERSION defined in raylib.h starting with "4.0".  This should be
   reflected in the rayConfirm.c output.  We can use VC information also, to
   indicate any assumptions that apply when VCrayApp is used.

 * We are going to need a way to export RAYLIB_VERSION so it can be used from
   scripts and even other commands.  This means there needs to be a program,
   also compiled with VC, that can establish the version that is in-hand and
   performed before any cache creation.  We only would do this if there is no
   cache or the "-c" option has been selected.  This can be done in cache\ so
   there is no messing with the user's src files and their location whether in
   src\ or elsewhere.  Also, app\ is undisturbed.

 * There might also be a compatibility check at compile time if the version
   detected in compiling rayConfirm is incompatible with the cache.  Things
   are brittle around this and we need to be careful in the case of an user
   source-code where there is no check and a version incompatibility comes up
   because the cache is stale.  There needs to be some precaution that must be
   made known somehow.

 * Go back through the 3.x releases until we find one that doesn't build a
   proper cache.  This will be the limit on defaulting to the 3.7 case.  We
   might want to make the oldest that works the default name though?  For
   VCrayVerify, it might be more sticky than that.  We should start with the
   3.7 assumption if there is no version.  We'll have to see about that
   concerning raylib examples.

 * It would be nice if there was a way to recompile rayConfirm.c without
   messing up any user development.  This would change the customization
   needed for switching to the users's source.  Just don't make things more
   brittle than they are already.  That is, we would have src\ as the default
   but how do we distinguish first run from later?
