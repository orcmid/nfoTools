TODO

 * Work toward VCrayApp 1.0.0 after 0.1.x beta(s)

  * Include a link on signature and hash checking in the manifest.  Also
   provide something more on the documentation for such things.

 * Update the materials for preparation of VCrayApp 0.1.0 (beta).

 * If for any reason, there needs to be a VCrayApp 0.1.1 or further, that
   can be developed on a separate branch using the VCrayApp\ artifacts that
   will be untouched there.  That needs to be mentioned on the checklist and
   also VCrayApp.txt.

 * There should probably be a good use of branching to handle the different
   cases.  Don't want to branch all of nfoTools though.

 * In app.txt there are 3 place-holders for fill-in by the time of 0.1.0
   release.  Beta must be the preview of the release candidate for 1.0.0 after
   any fixes and responses to problems and suggestions.

 * In .vscode.txt there is a link place-holder.  This should be dealt with
   by the time of VCrayApp 0.1.0 release.

 * Adjust VCrayApp.bat to do the following when a new cache is to be built.
   8. We don't know about releases after 4.2 at this time.  We will attempt
      to proceed and see what happens.  Work with 4.5-dev until it is
      released.  Then adjust and release 0.1.0 after the next raylib release.

 * Location of "..\..\raylib" in the script creates a lot of dependencies
   on raylib location in VCrayApp.bat.  It would be nice to reduce those.
   The brittleness of that and raylibCode.opt is troubling.

 * Add VCrayConfirm.c detection of the %APP_EXE% setting and report on what
   to do if it is set or not.  Indicate that no compiles of an App will happen
   until the variable is set in the beginning of VCrayApp.bat.

 * Add VCrayConfirm.c reporting of the %SRC% setting and report the assumption
   of it usage and what to do to change it.

 * Use a VCrayApp optional SET VCrayAppHost in VCrayApp.bat disambiguating
   the case of running VCrayApp embedded in an application's build/script
   process.

 * There needs to be consideration of customizations, such as for VCrayVerify.
   I'd like not to adjust much and I need to figure out, there, how to avoid
   customizing it every time there is a VCrayApp release.  There is enough to
   manage in VCrayVerify with regard to raylib changes, VC/C++ compatibility,
   etc.  Ideally, VCrayVerify would not need to change SRC and it might
   change APP_EXE separately.  We will use a customization where VCrayApp.bat
   setting of APP_EXE and SRC is removed and they are set by VCrayVerify.bat
   as needed.  The %VCrayAppHost% variable should simplify this.

 * Add a CHANGES.txt file to document the changes being made and to be added
   to the on-line documentation of VCrayApp 0.1.0.
