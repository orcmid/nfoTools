 ATTRIBUTION

   Hamilton, Dennis E. raylib App Build with VS Developer Command Prompt.
   nfoTools text file version 0.0.5 dated 2023-01-14, available on the
   Internet as a version of

TODO

 * Work toward VCrayApp 1.0.0 after 0.0.x alphas and 0.1.x betas

 * Add links to more and better information in the rayConfirm.c file.
   Replace place-holder <...> items with valid links.

 * Prepare an alpha release for early testing.  Establish prerequisites.

 * Remember how to setup all the digital signatures and provide that.

 * Include a link on signature and hash checking in the manifest.  Also
   provide something more on the documentation for such things.

 * Add attribution suggestion to NOTICE.txt.  It will be release-specific.

 * Update the materials for preparation of VCrayApp 0.1.0 (beta).

 * If for any reason, there needs to be a VCrayApp 0.0.1 or further, that
   can be developed on a separate branch using the VCrayApp\ artifacts that
   will be untouched there.  That needs to be mentioned on the checklist and
   also VCrayApp.txt.
