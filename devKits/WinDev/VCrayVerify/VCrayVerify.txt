           VCRAYVERIFY: TEST HARNESS FOR VERIFYING RAYLIB EXAMPLES
           =======================================================

    VCrayVerify is a a folder structure and batch (.bat) script that uses
    VCrayApp and a raylib source release or development clone to verify
    compilation of all of the raylib/examples/ that can be compiled by current
    Microsoft VC/C++ Build Tools.

    This folder is for the development, confirmation, and packaging of
    VCrayVerify.  The public availability of distributions and their
    usage is treated under docs/dev <https://orcmid.google.io/nfoTools/dev/>
    topics.

    There are a variety of confirmations achieved by running the VCrayVerify
    script:

     - successful compiling and execution of the examples in a raylib release
     - discrepancies in the examples because of breaking changes in a raylib
       (leading to contribution of updates to the examples if possible)
     - difficulties with an example because of problems in VCrayVerify,
       VCrayApp, and/or the (versions of) VC/C++ tools used

    Challenges

    There are some matters to be learned (by orcmid)on the kind of development
    progression and visualization/enactment in creating this fixture by
    using and also morphing the VCrayApp 0.1.0 release candidates.  Getting to
    the first least-than-can-possibly work and its predecessors that do tiny
    bits, as if in test-first development (without the failing business).  The
    idea is to have something that runs at every stage (similar to work on the
    orcmid/Adv10 game creation).

TODO

 * Provide for cycling through testcases and also
   reporting success.  Could run quiet or with a way to select the test or
   example to demonstrate.

 * I have decided to create VCrayVerify for the specific task of running
   raylib\examples\ progressively through a VCrayApp series with a setup and
   batch script.  In this case, it works by moving the examples into the
   reused VCrayApp setup as it goes. It might get away with not always moving
   code.  There are a number of challenges.  These will be found and resolved
   in VCrayVerify development.

 * This might be an example that can be morphed into test suites for other
   application developments, although I am also in love with the idea of
   Adv10 having its own verification built in by going solo through the game.

 * VCrayVerify.bat will have similar initial parameters to VCrayApp.  The
   internal calls on VCrayApp.bat will all use "+ *".

 * The default operation is to build and run all of the currently-covered
   examples.

 * There is a way to specify one of the 9 raylib\example\ subfolders.  There
   is a way to specify any of the individual programs having a VCrayVerify
   case.

 * NOTE: Not all files under an example\ subfolder have consistent namings.
   I can't assume that there is a single prefix for them all.  I will need
   to use specific names and maybe attempt prefixing in cases where a file
   is not otherwise found.

 * There is a way to do only what is specified or to continue from what is
   specified.

 * VCrayVerify.bat must have careful provisions for ensuring that the
   app\resources\ folder is the correct one, if any, for the case about to
   be verified.

 * VCrayApp provides feature information on raylib and this can be used by
   VCrayVerify for bypass cases involving different versions of VC/C++ and
   raylib.

 * Development starts with simple cases, starting with VCrayApp.bat as a
   boilerplate.  An explicit single compile is done first, followed by
   introduction of techniques for sequencing through folders.  The idea is
   to have sequencing work naturally and to have there be techniques to short-
   circuit it in several cases.

 * raylib examples include PNG files of what to expect in the display of the
   example.  It would be good to have presentation of these under option
   control, and maybe the default.

 * On startup, we always consider the VCrayAppV app\ folder to be dirty,
   including any app\resources\ folder.

 * On startup, should we always consider the VCrayAppV cache\ folder to be
   dirty also?  No, I don't think so.  I think we will depend on the "-c"
   option and also reporting the raylib version the current cache was built
   from.  Of course if the cache has not been built yet, we will use VCrayApp
   to do just that.

 * I am interested in confirming the audio\ and the text\ examples first,
   because of questions around dependencies there, especially UTF-8 and
   Unicode code points beyond U+00FF.
