rem When VCrayAppHost is set, a URL for additional handling of VCrayApp fails
rem will be presented if VCrayAppHostURL if set.  If set directly by a host,
rem the following SET will be commented (rem) out.

rem VCrayApp does not compile a project's source code until VCAPPEXE is set.
rem If a VCrayAppHost will set it, the line below will be commented out.
rem Otherwise, replace "RenameMe" in the setting of VCAPPEXE here.

REM VCAPPEXE=RenameMe.exe
rem Hint: don't use RenameMe.exe for your app.  Do use the complete .exe name.

rem VCrayApp will not attempt to compile a project's source code until
rem VCAPPSRC is also set. If a VCrayAppHost will set it, the line below will
rem be commented out.  Otherwise, your project should use the src\ folder here
rem in the VCrayApp folder.  For further information about VCrayApp
rem customizations see ^<https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101a/^>.

REM VCAPPSRC=src\*.c
rem VCrayApp treats this as a special case.  If this is defined to a location
rem and files elsewhere, a complete absolute location must be provided.
