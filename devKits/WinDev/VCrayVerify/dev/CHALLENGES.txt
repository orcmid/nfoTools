               CHALLENGES FOR VCRAYVERIFY OF raylib\examples\
               ==============================================

    Some raylib\examples will be challenging for a variety of reasons,
    including

      o not being compilable with the latest VC/C++ build tools
      o requiring extraordinary setup for VCrayAppV that may be difficult
        to arrange
      o having special constructions not compatible with VS build tools
        such as being developed only with gcc and shared-library structures

    We catalog and address challenges as we go.  That and TODOs must be
    managed.

    Working through these is going to teach me more about raylib than I might
    have been expecting.

CHALLENGING EXAMPLES CATALOG
============================

AUDIO
-----

    To be triaged.

    There are suspected possibilities of problems depending on the version of
    miniaudio incorporated by raudio.  We need a simple case to see if one
    works, then try them all.

CORE
----

    To be triaged.

MODELS
------

    To be triaged.

OTHERS
------

    To be triaged.

    There is an odd structure with its own externals.  These need to be
    included in searches or maybe loaded to app\ and src\, with compiling
    from there.

    externals\
        include\
        lib\        problematic here, is a *.a file.
    resources\

    rlgl_standalone.c seems to depend on gcc and the lib\.  Unclear how to
    handle that.  There might need to be a different example.

SHADERS
-------

    To be triaged.

TEXT
----

    To be triaged.  I am keen to have TTF cases working to get around the
    ugly default font.

    CJK is a particular concern here.

TEXTURES
--------

    To be triaged.
