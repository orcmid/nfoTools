        DEVELOP VCRAYVERIFY TEST HARNESS FOR VERIFYING RAYLIB EXAMPLES
        ==============================================================

    On GitHub, this folder is for the development, confirmation, and packaging
    of a VCrayVerify test suite.  This dev.txt file is incorporated in the
    VCrayVerify-0.0.0.zip package and extracted folder for reference and
    historical purposes.

    The structure of this folder is that of the intended test suite, apart
    from those components, such as a raylib source release, that must be
    obtained from elsewhere.  VCrayVerify is tested and developed in place
    in a dev\ folder and then the release content is separate out into the
    distributable VCrayVerify-0.0.0.zip.  For this and later releases, see
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D230202/>.

    A VCrayVerify folder will have its own raylib\ subfolder with an adjacent
    VCrayApp\ adaptation.  This keeps VCrayVerify operation separate from any
    use of raylib\ and VCrayApp for other purposes, especially where official
    stable releases are preferable.  VCrayVerify provides for verification
    with a variety of raylib releases, including clones of the current
    under-development raylib\ release.

    The VCrayAppV\ adaptation might use src\ as the location where copies of
    examples and other source codes are placed for compilation.  The app\
    folder will receive compiled examples and and resources\ subfolder for
    examples that expect one.

    Generally, VCrayVerify runs much like VCrayApp except for the selection
    of examples to (attempt to) build and run.  There is not so much about
    customization in contrast with VCrayApp.  VCrayVerify versions are used
    to adjust to new raylib\ and raylib\examples\ situations, and also such
    matters as VS Build Tools changes that impact support of C/C++ features.

    The development and staging of releases is along the same lines used for
    VCrayApp releases.  There is a similar checklist.

MANIFEST

    dev.txt

        materials.

    VCrayVerify-0.0.0.txt
        The synopsis, read-me, and manifest for VCrayVerify 0.0.0
        A signed version is available separately as as part of the
        VCrayVerify-0.0.0.zip and for independent examination from the
        release download page.

    VCrayVerify.bat
        The batch script for operation of VCrayVerify verifications of
        the raylib\example\ files and potentially others

    VCrayVerLast.bat
        A script for recording the version determined on the last cache
        creation of project VCrayAppV.

     NOTICE.txt
        Notification applicable to the VCrayVerify content

    VCrayAppV\
        The VCrayApp 0.1.0 beta release candidate that is used
        for the compiling-and-run step of each verification.

    raylib\ (not delivered, not under VCrayVerify source-control)
        An extracted raylib version (or developer clone) to verify, located
        as a peer of VCrayAppV\ as required for VCrayApp operation.

   raylib Examples, version 0.0.6 dated 2023-03-10, available on the Internet

TODO

 * Provide for cycling through testcases and also
   reporting success.  Could run quiet or with away to select the test or
   example to demonstrate.

 * I have decided to create VCrayVerify for the specific task of running
   raylib\examples\ progressively through a VCrayApp series with a setup and
   batch script.  In this case, it works by moving the examples into the
   reused VCrayApp setup as it goes. It might get away with not always moving
   code.  There are a number of challenges.  These will be found and resolved
   in VCrayVerify development.

 * This might be an example that can be morphed into test suites for other
   application developments, although I am also in love with the idea of
   Adv10 having its own verification built in by going solo through the game.

 * VCrayVerify.bat will have similar initial parameters to VCrayApp.  The
   internal calls on VCrayApp.bat will all use "+" and any "*" will be passed
   through from VCrayVerify.  It might be that we want terse all of the time
   in the hosted operation, VCrayAppV.  I think it will depend on whether we
   know what is being compiled and can tell what failures look like in the
   command prompt.

 * When -c is used with VCrayVerify, it will do a cache build at the beginning
   but not for subsequent operations in the same sequence of runs

 * When -r is used with VCrayVerify, it will cause the runs to occur.
   Otherwise, the setup is confirmed without compilation ?????????????????

 * The default operation is to confirm operation and then present the usage
   information.

 * There is a way to specify one of the 9 raylib\example\ subfolders.  There
   is a way to specify any of the individual programs having a VCrayVerify
   case.

 * There is a way to do only what is specified or to continue from what is
   specified.

 * VCrayVerify.bat must have careful provisions for ensuring that the
   app\resources\ folder is the correct one, if any, for the case about to
   be verified.

 * Check whether xcopy is available and usable for many of the operations

 * Determine where .vscode goes, even if not packaged in the deliverable.

 * Include dev.txt as a component of VCrayVerify so that history is packaged
   with this kind of development. Consider it for other development projects
   too.

 * I need to be cautious of VCrayApp customizations for VCrayVerify.  I want
   VCrayApp to be close to a drop-in as much as possible.

 * I will remove the %VCAPPEXE% and %VCAPPSRC% settings from VCrayApp.bat.
   That will be done by REM of those setting lines.  The approach in VCrayApp
   0.1.0 will fit perfectly.

 * I'm not thrilled about having a VCrayAppV folder although the idea is to
   have a project name.  To reflect the customization, I will make a notice,
   provide the host name, and remark out the SRC and EXE, letting them be
   set by VCrayVerify.

 * The file VCrayAppV-prologue.txt allows me to quickly drop in a new
   prologue file as part of recustomizing a new VCrayAppV drop-in.

 * Solve the problem of needing to know raylib versions even if the cache has
   not been run by having a file that holds a SET command from the last time
   A VCrayApp cache build was done.  The file is initially absent.  The -c
   option will cause that file to be deleted and the filling of the cache will
   be triggered.  VCVrayVerLast.bat will be the file name.

 * The value of VCrayVerLast should be reported somehow during operatin in
   cases where the cache is not rebuilt, serving as a reminder.  This file
   is not included in the distribution.

 * The -v option should be used to view the PNGs that go with the chosen
   examples.
