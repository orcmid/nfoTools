        DEVELOP VCRAYVERIFY TEST HARNESS FOR VERIFYING RAYLIB EXAMPLES
        ==============================================================

    This folder is for the development, confirmation, and packaging of a
    VCrayVerify test suite.

    The structure of this folder is that of the intended test suite.  It is
    tested and developed in place against particular versions of raylib.

    A VCrayVerify folder will have its own raylib\ subfolder with an adjacent
    VCrayApp\ adaptation.  This keeps VCrayVerify operation separate from any
    use of raylib\ and VCrayApp for other purposes, especially where official
    stable releases are preferable.  VCrayVerify provides for verification
    with a variety of raylib releases, including clones of the current
    under-development raylib\ release.

    The VCrayAppV\ adaptation employs src\ as the location where examples
    and other source codes are placed.  The app\ folder will receive compiled
    examples and the resources\ subfolder for examples that expects one.

    Generally, VCrayVerify runs much like VCrayApp except for the selection
    of examples to (attempt to) build and run.  There is not so much about
    customization in contrast with VCrayApp.  VCrayVerify versions are used
    to adjust to new raylib\ and raylib\examples\ situations, and also such
    matters as VS Build Tools changes that impact support of C/C++ features.

    The development and staging of releases is along the same lines used for
    VCrayApp releases.  There is a similar checklist.

TODO

 * Provide for cycling through testcases and also
   reporting success.  Could run quiet or with away to select the test or
   example to demonstrate.

 * I have decided to create VCrayVerify for the specific task of running
   raylib\examples\ progressively through a VCrayApp series with a setup and
   batch script.  In this case, it works by moving the examples into the
   reused VCrayApp setup as it goes. It might get away with not always moving
   code.  There are a number of challenges.  These will be found and resolved
   in VCrayVerify development.

 * This might be an example that can be morphed into test suites for other
   application developments, although I am also in love with the idea of
   Adv10 having its own verification built in by going solo through the game.

 * VCrayVerify.bat will have similar initial parameters to VCrayApp.  The
   internal calls on VCrayApp.bat will all use "+" and any "*" will be passed
   through from VCrayVerify.

 * The default operation is to build and run all of the currently-covered
   examples.

 * There is a way to specify one of the 9 raylib\example\ subfolders.  There
   is a way to specify any of the individual programs having a VCrayVerify
   case.

 * There is a way to do only what is specified or to continue from what is
   specified.

 * VCrayVerify.bat must have careful provisions for ensuring that the
   app\resources\ folder is the correct one, if any, for the case about to
   be verified.

 * Check whether xcopy is available and usable for many of the operations

 * Determine where .vscode goes, even if not packaged in the deliverable.
