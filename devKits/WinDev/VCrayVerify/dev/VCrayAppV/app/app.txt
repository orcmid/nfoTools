  *                                                                       *
  *    app\ is the standard VCrayApp subfolder into which a project's     *
  *    .exe executable code is compiled.  app\ is also the location for   *
  *    accompanying files/folders that must be adjacent to the .exe       *
  *    for correct operation.  This will depend on the nature of the      *
  *    project.                                                           *
  *                                                                       *
  *    app\ folder content is amenable to delivery in a Zip file after    *
  *    copying to a separate location, removal of extraneous material     *
  *    (such as this file), and addition of supporting content needed     *
  *    for the deployed result. The typical case is demonstrated at       *
  *    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/c>.                 *
  *                                                                       *
  *    The deployed folder can also be employed for derived materials     *
  *    of the running application including user information and saved    *
  *    history/state.  It is recommended that there be a means for the    *
  *    confirmation of correct installation and also accepting updates.   *
  *                                                                       *
  *    See <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101> for further    *
  *    details.                                                           *
  *                                                                       *
  *    If VCrayApp is re-extracted or is updated and extracted, this      *
  *    file and the .gitignore will be restored/replaced.  Any other      *
  *    files already in this folder will be untouched.  If there have     *
  *    been customizations, those should be renamed first to avoid        *
  *    collision.  Then review to see what changes need to be made, if    *
  *    any, to the fresh copies of app.txt and .gitignore.  There will    *
  *    usually be no need.                                                *
  *                                                                       *

MANIFEST

    app.txt
        this synopsis and manifest (not usually deployed by project)

    .gitignore
        excluding some VCrayApp app\ and compilation results from
        any Git so that modifications here are entirely local.
        (possibly customized or removed, not usually deployed with the app)

    resources\
        here when provided as a neighbor of the compiled .exe file and
        included in the app package (the typical raylib technique).  There
        may be other "assets" here, whether in subfolders or as companion
        files.

    *.exe
        here as the compiled product (deliverable), with the exe name
        specified for compilation with the VCrayApp command.  See
        <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/b>.

    *.obj
        files that are only transient here and not part of the app package
        (not to be deployed, usually remaining only if a compile fails)

    Other materials are part of the individual project and untouched by
    VCrayApp.  They should be preserved and backed-up as needed.  See
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/c>.
