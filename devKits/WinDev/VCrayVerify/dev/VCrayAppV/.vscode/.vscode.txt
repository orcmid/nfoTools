USAGE WITH VS CODE

    When a VCrayApp project is accessed via Visual Studio Code, the Windows
    folder that contains this .vscode folder should be the current directory.
    VS Code will then rely on configuration properties and variables of the
    Developer Command Prompt to integrate the project with raylib and with
    the Windows SDK libraries. The benefit is having intellisense for all of
    the project source code, including standard headers and their libraries.

    See <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/b/> for further
    details on using VS Code with VCrayApp.  For additional information on
    usage of VS Code, see <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T211001/>.
