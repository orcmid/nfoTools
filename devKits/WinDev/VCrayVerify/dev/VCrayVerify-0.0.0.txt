         VERIFYING RAYLIB EXAMPLES WITH VS DEVELOPER COMMAND PROMPT

  *                              CAUTION                                *
  *                              *******                                *
  *                                                                     *
  *    This is an alpha release of VCrayVerify.  There is incomplete    *
  *    information.  Alpha is intended for review and testing of the    *
  *    functionality.  It requires moderate self-reliance for use by    *
  *    novice developers.  Any problem reports out of operation may     *
  *    require additional skill in interpreting the results.            *
  *    There will be beta releases followed by stable releases.         *
  *       There may be breaking changes in that progression, although   *
  *    upgrading to use of a later version should not be difficult.     *
  *                                                                     *
  *                             IMPORTANT                               *
  *                             *********                               *
  *                                                                     *
  *    The raylib/examples/ are written in C Language and depend on     *
  *    C language raylib components.  In addition, VCrayVerify depends  *
  *    on the Microsoft VC C/C++ compiler and related developer tools   *
  *    on a Windows desktop PC, laptop or Microsoft Surface.  Su;pport  *
  *    is not available for other language bindings and platforms.      *
  *                                                                     *
  *    VCrayVerify 0.0.0 Uses a customized VCrayApp 0.1.0. VCrayVerify  *
  *    is tested and confirmed with raylib 4.0.0 code. Changes and      *
  *    incompatibilities in later versions of raylib may present        *
  *    issues for VCrayVerify operation.  Detecting and resolving such  *
  *    situations is part of VCrayVerify's utility as an instrument.    *
  *                                                                     *
  *    Further releases of VCrayVerify will extend coverage and adjust  *
  *    for more variations in raylib, its examples, and VS Build Tools. *
  *                                                                     *                                                                     *
  *                                                                     *

    The VCrayVerify-0.0.0 distribution is available on the web at
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D230202/D230202d/>.  Consult
    that page for the latest status, links to useful related material,
    and any more-recent version.  If there is concern for the authenticity
    or correctness of any VCrayVerify distribution, obtain a full replacement
    via <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D230202/>.

    VCrayVerify is designed to work with versions of Visual Studio that are
    free for personal/open-source use, including the Visual Studio Build Tools
    (recommended) and the Visual Studio Community editions.  Additional levels
    of licensed Visual Studio can also be used, all via their Native Tools
    Command Prompt.


 PREREQUISITES AND DEPENDENCIES

    Operation of VCrayVerify involves the following tools along with some
    confidence at understanding compilation errors and other error conditions
    that may be reported during VCrayVerify operation.

     * Windows File Explorer
     * Windows Built-in Zip-Folder Tool
     * Visual Studio Native Build Tools
     * Developer Command Prompt
     * Microsoft VC/C++ Command Line Compiler, CL.exe
     * raylib *source* code *release* 4.0.0 (or 3.7.0) downloaded and unzipped
     + GPG4Win for creation and verification of digital signatures
     + A text-editor for work on source code, other files, all in plain text
       (Visual Studio Code recommended for its C/C++ and Microsoft support)

    The first six (*) are essential.  The remainder (+) are optional and
    recommended mainly for your own development projects that make further use
    of, or contribute to, raylib and VCrayVerify.  There are alternatives.
    The specific ones happen to be those relied upon in the development of
    nfoTools projects.  For more information on dependencies, see
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D230202>.


DOWNLOADS AND SETUP

    It is recommended that you have already installed Visual Studio Native
    Build Tools and confirmed that the Developer Command Prompt is operating
    properly.  See <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T211002/>.

    If you have not already done so, choose where on your computer you want
    to have the VCrayVerify code.  There must be sufficient room for including
    a complete copy or raylib source into the VCrayVerify project folder.  See
    the setup arrangements at <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D230202/D230202a/>.

    Download VCrayVerify from <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D230202/d230202d/>.
    If a later version is available, consider using that version instead.

    It is useful to download VCrayVerify-0.0.0.zip to a location that you can
    use as a source of copies for one or more VCrayVerify setups, as in side-
    by-side comparision with different raylib versions.


EXTRACTION AND RENAMING OF VCrayVerify-0.0.0.zip CONTENT

    After downloading VCrayVerify-0.0.0.zip to a place where you want to keep
    it, make a copy to a place where you want to use it, if different.

    Right click on File Explorer VCrayVerify-0.0.0.zip and click
    "Extract all ..." in the context menu that appears.

    In the "Extract Compressed (Zipped) Folders" Dialog that appears,
    accept the "Files will be extracted to this folder:" choice that is
    offered automatically.

    Check the "Show extracted files when complete" entry.

    Click "Extract".

    There should now be a VCrayVerify-0.0.0\ folder in the same folder as the
    Zip file you extracted.  This is the verification-operation folder.  It
    can be renamed to suit your and may be important if you have more than
    one installation of the same version.

INCORPORATING A raylib\ FOLDER WITHIN YOUR VCrayVerify PROJECT.

***** EDITOR'S NOTE: THIS PORTION NOT FILLED-IN YET ******************


 CONFIRMING THE VCrayVerify SETUP AND OPERATION

    Using a Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt, navigate to the folder
    of the extracted VCrayVerify use the command

        VCrayVerify ?

    to confirm that the project folder is setup properly and that
    VCrayVerify.bat is operating.

    If that succeeds, use the command

        VCrayVerify -c

    This will compile raylib components to the VCrayAppV\cache\ folder and
    demonstrate that compilation with the installed raylib\ is successful.

    If there are any failure messages, correct for them until this command
    succeeds.  See <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D230202/> for
    additional information.  If an error message is from "[VCrayApp], see
    <https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/dev/D211101/> about those as well.
