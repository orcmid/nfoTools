              NATIVE WINDOWS CONSOLE APPLICATION CONSTRUCTION KIT
              ===================================================

    Windows Console (WinCon) construction sets are for compiling C/C++ console
    programs running in the native Windows Command Shell.  The building of the
    programs is accomplished using Microsoft command-line Development Tools
    and scripts of the construction set.
    
    WinCon Construction Kits provide templates for making WinCon construction
    sets for building, testing, and deploying specific native-Windows console 
    programs.
    
    This WinConKit directory holds the latest stable WinConKit version, 
    preserving it intact without interference from continuation work.  Testing
    and in-progress work on future versions is in the devWinConKit subfolder.
    
    Additional information about WinConKits and available stable releases
    can be found at <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161103.htm>.
    

WINCON CONSTRUCTION-KIT DESIGN POINT

    [This is about the design poinit of the construction sets that WinConKit
     is customizable for.]
     
    [It is not necessary to know how to create a WinCon construction set in
     order to use one.  Using one is pretty-much like pushing a button once
     any setup dependencies are resolved.]

  * PURPOSE: Reliable creation of dependable, easy-to-use WinCon construction
    sets.
   
  * PRINCIPLES
  
    o Prerequisites for customization from a WinConKit are the least needed
      beyond the prerequisites for using the derived WinCon construction set.
       
    o Created construction sets are suitable for novices to build and run
      the program the construction set is provided for.
      
    o Similarities among derived WinCon construction sets allow users and
      developers to form familiarity and repeatable experience with the
      many WinCon-style computer programs in nfoTools sub-projects and 
      elsewhere.
      
    o Close-to-the-metal operation based on .bat scripts and command-
      line usage is a stage for bootstrapping basic understanding of build 
      processes and their engineering, an opportunity for learning and for
      instruction.
      
    o The lifecycle and software-engineering considerations of construction  
      sets is addressed.

  
  * PRIORITIES:
  
  * PLAN
  
  * PEOPLE

    [This is about WinConKit itself and what it is oriented toward.  These
     are not exactly orthogonal considerations yet here it is about the ease of
     customization and confirmation of having a successful construction set.]
     
    [Metrics would be handy in this context as well]
     
    [Maintenance and continuation work on WinConKit is yet a different matter.
     That can be covered at devWinConKit.]
     
  * COUNTERPOINT: About advanced developers would use an advanced tool, even for
    a simple WinCon case.  We avoid that because we want the use of advanced
    tools to be motivated first and are after the least tooling and toolcraft
    that gets the job done.  There is a small dilemma here, because having the
    WinConKit be readily customizable involves needing great care in the 
    customization effort.  The skills and care demanded for customization, 
    testing, and trouble-shooting will be greater than simply using a WinCon 
    construction set.  
    
  * OPPORTUNITY: It is not automatic that something like the later introduction
    of Makefiles will eliminate WinConKit use and customization.  A natural
    use of Makefiles may be with the same WinCon structure and Makefiles that
    use the .bat files in procedure steps based on what propogation of 
    detected changes requires.
    
    
PREREQUISITES FOR DERIVING A WINCONKIT-BASED CONSTRUCTION SET

    [Include understanding a little about how batch parameters are defined
     and used.  This is intended to be straightforward, in contrast with
     the requirements at devWinConKit.]

    
DEPENDENCIES


    
   
MANIFEST

    .gitignore (applicable here and in a WinCon Construction Set)
        Ignoring folders that are created only for construction activity
        and not intended as part of the maintained source tree.  Although
        this folder is not intended for that, if the WinConKit is
        expanded for any reason, it will be kept out of the source tree.

    WinConKit-*.zip [TBD]
        The stable WinConKit package with components and templates for 
        making a WinCon Construction Set.

TODO

 * We will use an indirect level.  WinConKit/ is for deployment staging
   and fixing a branch.  This is redundant with the nfoWare site's deployment, 
   and that's no crime, just as for VCbinder and VCbind.
 
 * Tie to the WinConKit web presence and where distributions will be 
   provided.
   
 * Describe the design point for WinConKit including fully-native operation,
   absolute minimum dependency on freely available Microsoft development tools,
   ability for novices to successfully complete a build with minimum tacit
   knowledge, ability to use from initial compilation through completion of
   an under-development project, graceful learning curve in customizing
   WinCon construction sets for new projects.  Also, fully-exposed details
   of operation and confirmation of setup and getting clean-code compiles.
   
 * Links to Examples of customized WinCon construction sets need to be 
   provided on d161103.  We will use Adv10/dev/WinCon for one from here.
   
 * Some of what we say here seems to be also what should be expressed in
   the WinConKit-*.txt file and other content in WinConKit-*.zip or 
   linked therefrom.  Keep an eye on that.
   
 * The first WinConKit releases are going to be devoted to single CL.exe
   performances.  Having multiple build steps, use of makefiles, etc.,
   will lead to more modularity in the WinConKit and how pieces are 
   pulled together.  Need to anticipate that a little.
