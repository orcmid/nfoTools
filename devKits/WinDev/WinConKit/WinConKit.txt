              NATIVE WINDOWS CONSOLE APPLICATION CONSTRUCTION KIT
              ===================================================

    Windows Console Construction Sets are for C/C++ console applications
    running in the native Windows Command Shell.  The building of the
    program is accomplished using Microsoft command-line Development Tools.
    
    WinCon Construction Kits include a number of components and customization
    procedures for deriving a WinCon Construction Set for building, testing,
    and deploying a console program.
    
    This WinConKit directory holds the latest stable version, preserving it 
    intact without interference from continuation work.  Testing and in-
    progress work on future versions is in the devWinConKit subfolder.
    
    Additional information about WinConKit and its available stable releases
    can be found at <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161103.htm>.
    
WINCON CONSTRUCTION-SET DESIGN POINT

    [This is about the design poinit of the construction sets that WinConKit
     is customizable for.]
     
    [It is not necessary to know how to create a WinCon construction set in
     order to use one.  Using one is pretty-much like pushing a button once
     any setup dependencies are resolved.]


WINCON CONSTRUCTION-KIT DESIGN POINT

    [This is about WinConKit itself and what it is oriented toward.  These
     are not exactly orthogonal considerations yet here it is about the ease of
     customization and confirmation of having a successful construction set.]
     
    [Maintenance and continuation work on WinConKit is yet a different matter.
     That can be covered at devWinConKit.]
    
    
PREREQUISITES FOR DERIVING A WINCONKIT-BASED CONSTRUCTION SET

    [Include understanding a little about how batch parameters are defined
     and used.  This is intended to be straightforward, in contrast with
     the requirements at devWinConKit.]

    
DEPENDENCIES


    
   
MANIFEST

    .gitignore (applicable here and in a WinCon Construction Set)
        Ignoring folders that are created only for construction activity
        and not intended as part of the maintained source tree.  Although
        this folder is not intended for that, if the WinConKit is
        expanded for any reason, it will be kept out of the source tree.
        
    LICENSE.txt
    
    NOTICE.txt
        
    WinConKit.txt
        This description file on organization of the construction kit
        and use of its materials.
        
    devWinConKit/
        folder where in-progress development, testing, and release packaging
        happens in producing a stable distribution
         
    WinConKit-*.txt [TBD]
        Manifest and description file from WinConKit-*.zip for review and
        examination before extracting and appyling WinConKit-*.zip to
        creation of a WinCon construction set.      
    
    WinConKit-*.zip [TBD]
        The stable WinConKit package with components and templates for 
        making a WinCon Construction Set.

TODO

 * We will use an indirect level.  WinConKit/ is for deployment staging
   and fixing a branch.  This is redundant with the nfoWare site's deployment, 
   and that's no crime, just as for VCbinder and VCbind.
 
 * Tie to the WinConKit web presence and where distributions will be 
   provided.
   
 * Describe the design point for WinConKit including fully-native operation,
   absolute minimum dependency on freely available Microsoft development tools,
   ability for novices to successfully complete a build with minimum tacit
   knowledge, ability to use from initial compilation through completion of
   an under-development project, graceful learning curve in customizing
   WinCon construction sets for new projects.  Also, fully-exposed details
   of operation and confirmation of setup and getting clean-code compiles.
   
 * Links to Examples of customized WinCon construction sets need to be 
   provided on d161103.  We will use Adv10/dev/WinCon for one from here.
   
 * The lifecycle of a construction set needs to be considered somewhere.
   There is a maintenance impact on the effect of switching to a later
   WinConKit distribution on an existing WinCon construction set.  That
   requires consideration.
   
 * More work is needed on versioning of the construction set versus the
   version of WinConKit it is based on.  There must be a tidy way to
   have that explicit.
   
 * Some of what we say here seems to be also what should be expressed in
   the WinConKit-*.txt file and other content in WinConKit-*.zip or 
   linked therefrom.  Keep an eye on that.
   
 * The first WinConKit releases are going to be devoted to single CL.exe
   performances.  Having multiple build steps, use of makefiles, etc.,
   will lead to more modularity in the WinConKit and how pieces are 
   pulled together.  Need to anticipate that a little.  
   
 * The WinConKit folder is the source tree for releases.  Put appropriate
   LICENSE.txt and NOTICE.txt files her for use as the root of a 
   WinConKit-*-src.zip package.
   
 * Move VCbind-0.1.0.txt and VCbind.zip down to devWinConKit.  They will
   be part of the kit and not discussed at this level.
