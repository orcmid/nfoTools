              NATIVE WINDOWS CONSOLE APPLICATION CONSTRUCTION KIT
              ===================================================

    Windows Console Construction Sets are for C/C++ console applications
    running in the native Windows Command Shell.  The building of the
    program is accomplished using Microsoft command-line Development Tools.
    
    WinCon Construction Kit includes a number of components and customization
    procedures leading to a WinCon Construction Set for building, testing,
    and deploying a console program.
    
PREREQUISITES

    [TBD]
    
DEPENDENCIES


    
   
MANIFEST

    .gitignore (applicable here and in a WinCon Construction Set)
        Ignoring folders that are created only for construction activity
        and not intended as part of the maintained source tree.  This
        prevents local customizations of working material from infecting
        the shared public source-code tree.

    WinConKit.txt
        This description file on organization of the construction kit
        and use of its materials.
        
    VCenable.bat (from VCbinder)
        script for performing a VCbind operation using the extracted 
        VCbind.zip; the extraction is confirmed and then the VCbind.bat
        in the extracted material is performed.
        
    VCbind-0.1.0.txt (from VCbinder)
        manifest and instructions from VCbind.zip available for review
        before extracting VCbind.zip.
        
    VCbind.zip (from VCbinder)
        package which provides the working VC binding script when extracted
        to VCbind/ here.

TODO

 * Switch up to developing toward VCbind[er] 0.1.1 dependency.
 
 * Tie this to examples of where the Kit is used/developed.  
 
 * Does this require an indirect level?  That is, do we need a 
   devWinConKit layer below here?  Then WInConKit/ is the deployment
   level?  Reconcile with the working development of a WinConKit and
   having a point of access/deployment.  This is redundant with the
   nfoWare site's deployment, but that's no crime, just as for VCbinder
   and VCbind.
 
 * Tie to the WinConKit web presence and where distributions will be 
   provided.
 
 * Work up the Visual C++ console compilation case.
 
 * WinConBuild/ for doing it all using the command line.
 
 * Specify how the CL.exe command line parameters and options are 
   customized.
 
 * Add WinConRun for running the result of a WinConBuild (or VS/VC project?)
 
 * Add VSproject/ for doing all of this with Visual Studio.
 
 * Consider VScode for using Visual Code if we can get the workspace to
   work the way we need.  It does not appear that Visual Code compiles will
   work well with the code in a different place than where the build happens.
   There is also a problem with the code being in a different location than
   the workspace.  
 
 * Evaluate whether the CLang front end is an useful alternative.
 
 * Add something about more information on constructing and verifying
   a build, and simply using the result to play the game.
 
 * Add anything about developing/maintaining WinConKit.
   This can be by appropriate pointers.
   
 * It is not clear whether and how Micosoft Visual Studio Team Services
   online is helpful here, especially for WinCon builds.  However, figuring
   out Release Management and integration with Visual Studio Code are all
   interesting cases.  <https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/>.
   
 * There may need to be more layering here because of how packaging of piece
   parts may need to be worked up (e.g., in additional Zip files).
   
 * Work through this and have a statement somewhere about what has actually
   been tested:
        - Visual Studio Community 2015 with Update 3 (VS 14.0 C++ features)
     - Visual Studio Express 2015 for Windows Desktop (VS 14.0 C++ features)
     - Visual C++ Build Tools 2015 Update 3 (VS 14.0 C++ features)
     - Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows Desktop Update 5 
       (VS 12.0 C++ features)
     - Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows Desktop (VS 11.0 C++ features)
    Probably Obsolete and no longer available for download: 
     - Visual Studio 2010 Express (VS 10.0 C++ features, via Studio 2010 SP1 ?)
     - Visual Studio Express 2008 (VS 9.0 C++ Express features)
     - Visual C++ Express 2005 (VS 8.0 C++ features)

 0.0.2 2016-12-04-12:40 Further Adjustments.  Import more notes from Adv10
       that belong here instead of a derived (or prototype) construction set.
       Identify VCenable.bat as the kickoff for the tool chain.
 0.0.1 2016-11-30-20:45 Initial customization for WinConKit.
 0.0.0 2016-11-30-16:43 Initial Placeholder from the WinCon.txt 0.0.8 file
       in the Adv10/dev/WinCon/ construction set.
