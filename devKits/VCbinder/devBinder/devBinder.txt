                            VCBINDER SOURCE CODE
                            ====================

    This folder provides the files and the procedure for composing
    a VCbinder.zip distribution.

MANIFEST

    .gitignore
        preventing any VCbind/ and VCbinder/ working sub-folders from
        inclusion in devBinder source-code version control; included in 
        VCbinder.zip for the same purpose.
        
    devBinder.txt
        This description and manifest for the devBinder/ source code
        
    LICENSE.txt
        Apache License Version 2.0 for inclusion .zip
        (part of this source and part of VCbinder-0.1.0.zip)
         
    NOTICE.txt
        Notice file for inclusion in VCbinder.zip
        (part of this source and part of VCbinder-0.1.0.zip)
        
    VCbinder-0.1.0.txt (part of VCbinder-0.1.0.zip)
        The manifest and procedure file that is incorporated in 
        VCbinder-0.1.0.zip.  This provides information on the procedure
        without having to download/open VCbinder-0.1.0.zip first.
        Note that VCbinder-0.1.0.txt/.zip are not added to construction
        sets.  It is selected extracts from VCbinder-0.1.0.zip that
        are.
               
    VCbind.bat (part of VCbinder-0.1.0.zip) [** TBD **]
        Script that can be placed in a construction set to relay into the
        VCbind\Vcbind.bat script after first checking that the VCbind script
        is in place.  This might not be a good idea.
        
    VCbind-0.1.0.txt (part of VCbinder-0.1.0.zip)
         copy of the same file from VCbind.zip so that it can be read before
         any VCbind.zip extraction, as may be desired.
         
    VCbind.zip (part of VCbinder-0.1.0.zip)
         The VCbind 0.1.0 package procedure that is delivered in the 
         current VCbinder
         
    VCbinder-0.1.0.zip
          The under-development VCbinder artifact for integration of 
          VCbind elements into the source-code version-control of a 
          construction set.  The latest stable artifact is at VCbinder\

TODO

 * Provide the construction procedure.
   
 * Resolve whether that is the VCbinder.txt that is provided in the 
   superior VCbinder/ folder.  It seems so, since the one is versioned and
   the other is not.  VCbinder is just a staging place for the dist version,
   so developing of the next one can happen asynchronously at devBinder/.  
  
 * Reflect: BINDING THE VC COMPILER
    The VCbind.bat here is used to check that VCbind.zip is here and that a
    the extracted VCbind\VCbind.bat file is present for use.  If Vcbind.zip
    has not been extracted, the user will be instructed to extract it and
    retry.
    The VCbind.zip file is extracted to provide the script that establishes
    a compiler setup.  VCbind.txt describes that package and its usage.
    
 * Speed this up just enought to expedite confirmation and provisional
   use in the progressing of Adv10 WINCON development.
