                             VCBIND.ZIP CONSTRUCTION
                             =======================
                             
    The files and the VCbind.zip here are in-progress development versions. 
    For the latest version considered stable for general use, check the
    parent VCbinder/ folder for how VCbinder/devBind is used and the version
    of VCbind.zip incorporated there.  For further information on VCbind,
    it's development, latest downloads, and the relationship to (open-)source
    construction sets, see <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161101.htm>.
 
    The details of VCbind.zip and its usage are in the VCbind-x.y.z.txt file
    for the particular version (e.g., VCbind-0.1.0.txt).  That file is part
    of the VCbind.zip content.  It is useful to include the applicable
    VCbind-x.y.z.txt alongside VCbind.zip so users of a construction set 
    can (1) determine how to proceed before extracting VCbind.zip content 
    itself, can (2) identify the version of VCbind to determine its current
    status, and can verify that the VCbind.zip is of the same version.
       
    Extensive details are provided here and in VCbind.zip to support non-
    expert testing and confirmation of VCbind operation.  Someone without the 
    experience to have developed VCbind themselves should still be able to use
    it to confirm its functioning and to make adaptations/variations as more 
    is learned. 
           
    
USING VCBIND.ZIP

    The VCbind-x.y.z.txt file of a given VCbind.zip provides the instructions
    for its usage in a construction set that employs VCbind.  

    To obtain the VCbind currently recommended for general usage, consult
    <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161101b.htm>. 
    
    
DEPENDENCIES FOR VCBIND

    Beside built-in Microsoft Windows utilities, VCbind depends only on 
    freely-available versions of Visual Studio Software, whether Express or 
    Community editions.  
    
    There is no reliance on the Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment
    (IDE) itself, just the command-line compiler and development tools.
    
    Have a text editor that is suitable for viewing/editing plsintext, batch 
    scripts, source codes, and compiler error logs.
    
    The same dependencies apply to development work on VCbind itself.
    
    Providing ways to make use of IDEs, even though building from the command
    line are the subject of potential future VCbind or related releases.
    
    
PREREQUISITE CAPABILITIES FOR VCBIND DEVELOPMENT WORK

    If you are inexperienced with use of the Windows command shell, of the 
    Visual C/C++ compiler, and of related command-line tools, familiarization
    with operation of VCbind can be gained by using it as specified in an
    existing construction set.  Practice with any construction set that
    produces a simple command-line program from a stable source code release.
    
    The next level of skill might be going through the testing and confirma- 
    tion of VCbind.zip as provided in its distributions.

    Then inspect this devBind material.  Review and test the maintenance
    procedure, identifying questions that need to be resolved.  Determine
    capabilities to work on, if any.  
      
    Going deeper may involve expanding skills in several areas.  The 
    following checklist can be used to assess where study and experience
    may be needed.
    
     * Working with the source-code management system, if any, that this
       source code folder originates at, currently the GitHub project at
       <http://github.com/orcmid/Adv10>.
    
     * Performing console (cmd.exe) command-line sessions on Microsoft 
       Windows  
       
     * Editing of text and batch (.bat) files in a manner that preserves
       formatting and conventions for them
    
     * Experience with the built-in Compressed (zipped) Folder support of
       Microsoft Windows.  Optional use of alternative compression software
       in a manner that is compatible with the built-in provisions.
    
     * Demonstrating the testing and confirmation of VCbind.bat operation,
       including all of the exception cases
    
     * Using the Microsoft cl.exe command-line compiler in demonstration of
       successful VCbind accomplishment
       
     * Optionally creating shortcuts to batch files and customizing the
       console session's properties
  
     * Further understanding and using the command-line environment of 
       Windows and how the Visual C++ components are found and operated on
       Windows
    
  
DEVBIND EMHANCEMENT AND MAINTENANCE CODE-AND-TEST CYCLE

  1. Have this source code folder in a PC location where you can edit all 
     of its content.  If the folder is not named devBind\, adjust what 
     follows below accordingly.  It is recommended that you have a clone
     or fork of the origin repository in order to have source-code control
     of your changes, whether or not for contribution back to the origin
     project.
     
  2. In the devBind\ folder, follow the VCbind-x.y.z.txt instructions and
     extract VCbind.zip to the subfolder VCbind\ (i.e., Windows 
     folder location devBind\VCbind\).
     
     The following steps have been employed in the original progression
     of devBind work.  There are many ways to accomplish the same result.
     The key is to always know what files are the latest and not risk
     using older versions by mistake.
     
  3. Edit the VCbind.bat and VCbind-x.y.z.txt files here in the devBind\ 
     folder.  Copy modified VCbind.bat files to devBind\VCbind\ for testing 
     and confirmation of test cases.  Confirm that the cl.exe compiler can be
     operated and that successful compilations are produced.  The semantic
     versioning identifier presented by VCbind.bat and in the naming of
     VCbind-x.y.z.txt will depend on the purpose of your modifications.
     See <http://semver.org/>.
    
  4. Wnen your work is completed or at an intermediate check-point, synchronize
     VCbind.zip to have your changes.
  
     4.1 Update VCbind-x.y.z.txt and related documentation and testing material.
  
     4.2 Delete the devBind\VCbind.zip file.
     
     4.2 In the Windows File Explorer, creat a New Compressed (zipped) Folder
         in devBind\.  Name it VCbind.zip.
         
     4.3 Drag the all of the VCbind.zip-intended devBind\ files into the 
         new, empty VCbind.zip, including LICENSE.txt, NOTICE.txt, VCbind.bat,
         and VCbind-x.y.z.txt.
         
  5. Adjust this devBind.txt to reflect any change to the manifest and 
     anything else that needs to be changed to have current documentation.
     
  6. Check-in the modified/new materials under the source-code management
     you are using.  Depending on the state of completion and project
     requirements for thorough testing, contribute back to any project
     your work is being contributed to.

TODO

    In addition to these TODO items, the web-facing material on 
    <http://nfoWare.com> has a Diary and Job Jar of VCbind items
    at <http://nfoWare.com/dev/2016/11/d161101a.htm>.
  
 * Provide links for resolving the dependencies.
   
 * Provide links for the prerequisites.  Also to examples of where VCbind
   is used in cases that are relatively easy to teeth on.
   
 * Confirm that the VS 2013 Build Tools also provide a C/C++ compiler.
 
 * Test with Visual Studio C++ Express 2008.
 
 * Link to an illustrated procedure for the extraction from VCbind.zip.
 
 * Link to an illustrated procedure with regard to desired Windows desktop
   options for performing developer and trouble-shooting work.
   
 * Link to an illustrated procedure for the easiest way to fire up VCbind.bat.
 
 * Link to an illustrated procedure for firing up a command-shell session,
   navigating to VCbind\ or other place, performing a VCbind.bat operation,
   and use the resulting environment in the session.
   
 * Split VCbinder out of the Adv10 source-code tree for (quasi-)independent 
   development.  This is worthy of an 0.1.1+ distribution, with new source
   location.  When that is completed, the Adv10/dev/VCbinder can be branched
   out after Adv10/dev/WinCon is updated to use that 0.1.1+ code.
   
 * Does a branch remain available even if it is merged back to master?
 
 * For the nfoWare.com d161101c-dist, there is more to do in identifying where
   the source code is maintained, more about toolcraft with Git, and also 
   the use of Git command-line operations in addition to any GitHub reliance.
   
 * The VCbind-x.y.z.txt should point to the download folder, not the page 
   for the version.  The idea is that the download folder is all about the
   downloading, verifying the materials, and then maybe the smoke tests.
   
 * Fix the VCbind\ folder description in VCbind.txt section one to indicate
   that restoration as stated impacts only the material from VCbind.zip and
   not anything the user put there.
   
 * Decide whether information about use of the source is best at the release
   page (e.g., d161101c) or the distribution description (e.g., d161101c-dist)
   or perhaps divided between the two.
   
 * The source discussion should emphasize that this is Code in the Open, and
   not an organized open-source project, despite the licensing.
   
 * It should be emphasized that if a terse failure case is unclear, 
   VCbind should be performed directly without the terse "*" flag.
   This should probably be in :USAGE and elsewhere.
