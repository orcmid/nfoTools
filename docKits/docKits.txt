                     DOCKITS CONSTRUCTION KITS AND HELPERS
                     =====================================

    Documentation in various forms is a common requirement for projects.
    A docKit is a set of aids with regard to a particular type/form of
    documentation.

    This is not about document processing software, although there is a
    connection.  nfoWorks, not nfoTools is more applicable to document
    processing.  For example, the orcmid/DocInterop project is applicable
    to that domain.

    The docEng project is devoted Document Engineering and arrangements
    developed there is applicable to documentation of nfoTools itself.
    This may reduce the importance of docKits here, although support for
    documentation about and derived from code may be relevant.

    How and whether docKits are needed in support of literate programming
    or other mixe cases remains open until there is an indentified case.
    There may be usability and user-experience elements that apply here as
    well.  Whether docKits is an appropriate umbrella remains to be seen.

TODO

 * Add attribution statement

 * Tie to docEng more strongly when there is something to rely on there.

 * Look at code-related documentation and maybe UX as well.
