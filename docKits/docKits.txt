                     DOCKITS CONSTRUCTION KITS AND HELPERS
                     =====================================

    Documentation in various forms is a common requirement for projects.
    A docKit is a set of aids with regard to a particular type/form of
    documentation.

    This is not about document processing software, although there is a
    connection.  nfoWorks, not nfoTools is more applicable to document
    processing.  For example, the orcmid/DocInterop project is applicable
    to that domain.

    The main thrust for docKits will be components that can be instrumental
    in documentation of projects and products developed on GitHub.  The kits
    may be useful to developers and even moreso to those who author material
    in support of user-facing open-source products.

TODO

 * Add attribution statement

 * Look at GitHub+Markdown authoring cases, including for nfoTools/docs and
   also wikis.  This will be rather cross-cutting and organization needs to
   emerge carefully.
