                GNU SCIENTIFIC LIBRARY (GSL) DEPENDENCY
                =======================================

    The latest release of GSL, the GNU Scientific Library, is employed here
    for reference purposes and confirmation of software that depends on it.
    The library is a collection of numerical routines for scientific
    computing.

    GSL is described as free software that can be redistributed and/or
    modified if under the terms of the GNU General Public License. It is
    unfortunated that LGPL, the license for libraries was not applied.

    It is asserted in the library that The GNU General Public License does
    not permit the software to be redistributed in proprietary programs.

    *                                                                  *
    *  WARNING: Reliance on this library in other programs requires    *
    *  those programs to be licensed under the same terms, including   *
    *  making the source code of those programs freely available.      *
    *                                                                  *
    ********************************************************************

    Files of the GSL are employed here for the purpose of reviewing and
    verifying other software, such as dieharder, that rely on the GSL
    and are licensed accordingly.  There is no intention of producing
    new/alternative software that has any such GSL dependency.

    IMPORTANT: The GSL library is not incorporated in the nfoTools GitHub
    repository.  It is extracted into the nfoTools working set, but not
    preserved in the nfoTools repository on GitHub.
