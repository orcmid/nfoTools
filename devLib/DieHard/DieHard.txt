            DIEHARD RANDOM-GENERATOR TESTS AND REFERENCE MATERIALS
            ======================================================

    Dieharder is a random number generator (rng) testing suite. ...
    Perfect random number generators produce "unlikely" sequences of random
    numbers -- at exactly the right average rate. Testing a rng is therefore
    quite subtle.

MANIFEST

    DieHard.txt
        This description file on organization of the archive and use of its
        materials.

    diehard-fortran/

       are the programs extracted from diehard-fortran.tgz.

    nfoGenRandsKit/
       Project for constructing diehard-acceptable generators of files to be
       subjected to diehard and other tests

    diehard-fortran.tgz
       package of the diehard-fortran files that are extracted into the
       diehard-fortran/ folder.  diehard-fortran.tar.gz file available from
       <https://ftpmirror.your.org/pub/misc/diehard/> and also from

    Marsaglia-CDROM-Title.pdf
       capture of the title of the CD carrying George Marsaglia's giant set of
       random numbers and the diehard software. Web page for the sources used
       to access diehard-fortran.tar.gz

    Amiller-2001-03-08-diehard.txt
       Alan J. Miller's description on use of Amiller-2004-01-14-diehard.f90
       along with a critique of the Fortran language in diehard-fortran.tgz.
       See DIEHARD in the list at <https://wp.csiro.au/alanmiller/#misc>.

    Amiller-2004-01-14-diehard.F90
       Alan J. Miller's transposition of Marsaglia Fortran into a single-file
       source in Fortran-90 language.

    Amiller-t_taus88.f90
       Alan J. Miller's program for generating a large file to run through the
       DieHard tests.  An example for generating files from other generators.

NOTES AND TODO

   * Assess for factoring out for development of individual tests.

   * I need to develop two-way conversions between ASCII uint32_t streams and
     binary 4-byte 32-bit word streams.  I need them to verify input-output
     of streams.  This will include an nfoAsc2Bin an nfoBin2Asc (maybe), and
     also, nfoBIO-more (or -head, or unlikely nfoBIO-less) and nfoBIO-tail but
     I want control on movement back and forth, forth and back.  I'm uncertain
     how this can happen nicely without a text window.

   * KISS - get what I need mostly, don't embellish until necessary.
