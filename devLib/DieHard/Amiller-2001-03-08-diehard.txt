DIEHARD
-------

Diehard is George Marsaglia's set of 15 tests of generators of random
INTEGERS.   Most of the tests are not suitable for tesing generators
of floating-point numbers between 0 and 1; they concentrate on testing
the randomness of bits within integers.

DIEHARD.F90 has been developed from Fortran code downloaded from:
http://stat.fsu.edu/pub/diehard
by Alan Miller (amiller @ bigpond.net.au).

The Fortran code at the above site is NOT in standard Fortran and
will not compile using any compiler known to the author of this note.

DIEHARD.F90 is in standard Fortran - it will even compile using Lahey's
ELF90 compiler which only supports a subset of Fortran.

To use this version of Diehard:
1. Compile the file DIEHARD.F90
   It contains a main module with all of the tests, followed by a driver
   program.

2. Generate a binary file of random 32-bit integers using the random
   number generator which you want to test.   This file should contain
   4096 blocks of 4096 integers in an unformatted direct access file.
   See the file t_taus88.f90 for an example.

3. Make sure that the file 'tests.txt' is in the same directory as your
   executable file.

4. When you run the program DIEHARD.EXE, you will be asked for the name
   of a file.   Enter the name of the binary file containing the random
   integers.   You will then be asked to enter a string of 15 1's indicating
   which tests you want to be run.   e.g. If you enter 101010101010101,
   tests 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 will be run.
   You will be asked to enter the name of a file to receive the report.
