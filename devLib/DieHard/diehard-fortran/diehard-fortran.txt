             ORIGINAL DIEHARD FORTRAN 77 PROGRAMS PRESERVATION
             =================================================

MANIFEST

    diehard-fortran.txt (additional)
        This description on organization of the archive and use of its
        materials.  Files identified as additional, such as this one,
        are not part of the original distribution.  They are provided
        for purposes of explanation and convenience.

    asc2bin.f
        Fortran 77 program to convert a generated ASCII file of 32-bit
        random numbers in hex format to the raw binary file form required as
        input to diehard (and dieharder).  This format does not work for
        interchange because of issues around endian-ness and other differences
        in number formats on different platforms. On nfoTools, this form will
        always be for transient files in generations and tests of them.

    diehard.doc
      This is the original description for the MS DOS executables in the
      original CD-ROM distribution.

    diehard.doc.pdf (additional)
        PDF created from diehard.doc using the Windows Print to PDF from
        the current Microsoft Word.

    diehard.f
        Fortran 77 code for the original diehard program.  This establishes
        the use of pure binary files of generated numbers to be tested for
        their approximity to actual random numbers.  It also introduces a
        15-digit parameter of 1's and 0's to specify which of the 15 tests
        to run.

    diequick.f
        Fortran 77 code for a version of diehard that simply runs all 15
        tests on a given binary file in diehard input format.

    getrnor.f
        Fortran 77 code for a program that takes a diehard input file of
        (presumably) uniform 32-bit random numbers and produces a diehard
        file of normally-distributed numbers from those

    makef.txt
        File of text descriptions used by makewhat.f in responding to one of
        16 offered generator options

    makewhat.f
        Fortran 77 code for a program to generate a diehard-format binary
        file using one of 16 generators, using user-submitted parameters

    meld.f
        Fortran 77 code for a program to merge the data in two diehard-
        format binary files into a single file of 2,498,560 32-bit numbers
        where corresponding numbers have been XOR-ed or added according to
        an user option.

    operm5d.ata
        A 330,949 byte d.ata file consisting of 3,662 signed integers in
        458 records with 8 numbers each (but only 6 in the 458-th).

    tests.txt
        A listing of the text descriptions of the 15 tests, in the sequence
        they are selectable in the 15-digit parameter to diehard.  The
        compiled diehard.f program accesses this file.

NOTES AND TODO

 * As alternatives are available, indicate them here.

 * The original diequick.f has top-of-file dependencies on the following *.obj
   files: allbrank, cdosum, cdoperm5, asort, kstest, and phi.  These are named
   in a comment.  The expectation is that they are available/provided.
      In fact, every one except allbrank are found in diehard.f. I cannot find
   any reference to allbrank in either diehard.f or diequick.f.  There are
   interesting occurences of "rank" though.
