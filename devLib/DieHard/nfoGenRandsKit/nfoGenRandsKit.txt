              KIT FOR GENERATING DIEHARD-ACCEPTABLE TEST FILES
              ================================================

    Dieharder is a random number generator (rng) testing suite. ...
    Perfect random number generators produce "unlikely" sequences of random
    numbers -- at exactly the right average rate. Testing a rng is therefore
    quite subtle.

NOTES AND TODO

   * Assess for factoring out for development of individual tests.

   * I am reluctant to use the diehard binary files because of the problem
     of numerical byte order and also difficulty detecting damage or
     corruption in storage.  Also binary piping is not necessarily very
     reliable.

   * Work variations on binary output, ASCII format, and also possibly
     base64 encoding of files.  My suspicion is that these operations are
     input-output bound and better encoding will work just fine.

   * It would be interesting to run compression algorithms on these files.
     They should not be compressible.

   * Use the VCrayApp model for kit development here.
