*         -----------------------------------------------------------
*
*   This nfoGenRands.h file is a template to be customized with details of
*   a random-number generator to be exercised in an nfoGenRands program.
*
*  UNDER CONSTRUCTION - PLACEHOLDER FOR GENERATOR SCHEME TO BE DESCRIBED
*/

/* NOTES AND TODOS

   * Describe naming the generator scheme as the first step.

   * Describe copying and renaming this template file as the second step.

   * Fill in the naming of the generator and version in the third step.

   * We'll need to figure out the parameters needed and how it works with
     the nfoGenRands.c provision of command-line options/parameters.

   * Explain where this goes in the #includes of nfoGenRands.c and how
     that works with regard to adding in-line content and also needing
     any additional #include files for the generator implementation
     being used.
