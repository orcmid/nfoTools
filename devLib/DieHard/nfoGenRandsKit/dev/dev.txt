                         ==========================



MANIFEST

    dev.txt
        This description file on organization of source code and compilation
        of nfoGenRandsKit releases.

    diehardPatternScraps.txt
        Copy of diehardPattern from nfoGenRandsKit that is scavenged for
        C Language code and the header file.

    nfoGenAIO.c
        procedures nfoGenAIO_read() and nfoGenAIO_write() to input and output
        ASCII files of 32-bit words codes in 8 hexadecimal digits each. The
        file formats are compatible with the ASCII form used for DieHard
        tests.

    nfoGenAIO.h
        header file for use of nfoGenAIO.c procedures with DieHard and other
        utilities for which hex recording of 32-bit word data is useful.

    nfoGenBIO.h
        header file for use of nfoGenBIO-*.c procedures with DieHard and other
        platform utilities for which binary recording of 32-bit word data is
        useful.

    nfoGenBIO-Win32.c
        Win32 platform-specific implementations of some nfoGenBIO.h functions

    nfoGenBIO-more.c
        Program to display binary files in 16-line 8-word console chunks

    nfoGenAsc2Bin.c
        Program to convert AIO-input-compatible files to BIO-binary files

    nfoGenCombo.c
        Generator of test files for the Marsaglia COMBO RNG.  This is an
        exemplar of the typical generator.

    nfoGenRNG-template.c
        "Template" program file for incorporating an RNG and generating
        sets of random numbers for diehard-style testing, as exemplified by
        nfoGenCombo.c.

NOTES AND TODO

   * Make simple cases for generating fixed values and also data from some
     known software RNGs.

   * Work variations on binary output, ASCII format, and also possibly
     base64 encoding of files.  My suspicion is that these operations are
     input-output bound and better encoding will work just fine.

   * Use the VCrayApp model for kit development here.

   * I am thinking about having three flavors of output, ASCII hex values,
     ASCII base64 values, and pure binary.  The ASCII hex would be the
     default.  I want performance comparisons between the 3 cases to see
     what the differences might be.

   * nfoGenAIO needs an nfoGenAIO_reset() to allow optional change of
     FILE* fp, resetting of the nfoGenAIO_read buffer.  Clearing of any
     input-output error/EOF state must be done by the user, however.

   * nfoGenBIO.h needs an nfoGenBIO-Win32.c to deal with opening of a
     temporary file in the current working directory (typically where the
     .exe is on my PC).  The idea is to have the files be on a SSD and be
     where there is much room for development and data purposes.  So
     particularly where DieHard (or DieQuick) are operated.  It looks like
     this is platform specific.

   * So the temp creation might need to be optional.  The application can
     be built to always supply the FILE* to use.

   * I can always change TMP in a script.  That would mean having to use a
     script to run an app using nfoGenBIO though.

   * Have to rationalize this with the consumption of BIO files in RNG
     assessments as well.  How the RNG test set will learn of and use the
     appropriate file.

   * I wonder if the consumer should specify where the test file should be
     produced.  It's late and I think I will come at this more clear-headed.

   * I wonder if raylib's external/rdrand.h sets RAND_MAX or is there a
     collision there.  I also wonder why the generator used there is not
     offered for single rand( )-equivalent calls.

   * I must test the generator used by raylib in rdrand.h.

   * When I typed an attribution to co-pilot line in nfoGenBIO.h, two names
     of people I don't know were suggested.  I must look into that just for
     fun.

   * I also need to be clear about copilot-assisted code.

   * I wonder if I can select the header file as part of the command-line
     or options when making the code to create a particular RNG test stream.

   * Clean up these items based on the refined approach to this.

   * I need nfoGenBIO-more.c and nfoGenBIO-last.c as hex-displays that I can
     navigate all sizes of binary file, maybe in a kind of dump format.

   * Develop -more and -last versions of viewers for binary files of the kind
     expected in DieHard tests.  These will be used in testing other cases
     for the Miser Project and that is behind this activity, as well as
     testing the raylib RNGs :).

   * Some of these utilities could be moved to a higher level in devLib,
     even though they have been created to work with DieHard RNG tests.
     I think I'll keep them here, but releases might be separately under
     tools.

   * I need versions of Asc2Bin and Bin2Asc also.  The second could be used
     as an alternative to -more, and will depend on how well ^S and ^Q work
     in shells.

   * I can use <io.h> and _isatty(_fileno(stdout and stdin)) to determine if
     those are tied to a terminal or if assigned instead to an indirect or
     file.
     <see https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/isatty>
     For ngoGenBIO I have nfoGenBIO-win32.c to work with.

   * Make nfoGenAIO-win32.c in order to know about redirection, so I don't
     have to request a filename from the command line for input.  I need this
     in various conversion routines, but I maybe can't use it in DieHard tests
     themselves.  The question is whether I can rewind and also do so in a
     series of functions.  That *might* work if I put them all into one
     program.  More to figure out.
