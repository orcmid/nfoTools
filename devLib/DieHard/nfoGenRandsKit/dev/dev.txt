                         NFOGENRANDSKIT DEVELOPMENT
                         ==========================

    Dieharder is a random number generator (rng) testing suite. ...
    Perfect random number generators produce "unlikely" sequences of random
    numbers -- at exactly the right average rate. Testing a rng is therefore
    quite subtle.

NOTES AND TODO

   * Make simple cases for generating fixed values and also data from some
     known software RNGs.

   * Work variations on binary output, ASCII format, and also possibly
     base64 encoding of files.  My suspicion is that these operations are
     input-output bound and better encoding will work just fine.

   * Use the VCrayApp model for kit development here.
