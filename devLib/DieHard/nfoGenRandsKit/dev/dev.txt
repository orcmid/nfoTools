NOTES AND TODO

   * Make simple cases for generating fixed values and also data from some
     known software RNGs.

   * Work variations on binary output, ASCII format, and also possibly
     base64 encoding of files.  My suspicion is that these operations are
     input-output bound and better encoding will work just fine.

   * Use the VCrayApp model for kit development here.

   * I am thinking about having three flavors of output, ASCII hex values,
     ASCII base64 values, and pure binary.  The ASCII hex would be the
     default.  I want performance comparisons between the 3 cases to see
     what the differences might be.
