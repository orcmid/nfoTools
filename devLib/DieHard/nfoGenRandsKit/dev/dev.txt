                         ==========================



MANIFEST

    dev.txt
        This description file on organization of source code and compilation
        of nfoGenRandsKit releases.

    diehardPatternScraps.txt
        Copy of diehardPattern from nfoGenRandsKit that is scavenged for
        C Language code and the header file.

    nfoGenAIO.c
        procedures nfoGenAIO_read() and nfoGenAIO_write() to input and output
        ASCII files of 32-bit words codes in 8 hexadecimal digits each. The
        file formats are compatible with the ASCII form used for DieHard
        tests.

    nfoGenAIO.h
        header file for use of nfoGenAIO.c procedures with DieHard and other
        utilities for which hex recording of 32-bit word data is useful.

    nfoGenBIO.h
        header file for use of nfoGenBIO.c procedures with DieHard and other
        utilities for which binary recording of 32-bit word data is useful.

    nfoGenBIO-Win32.c
        Win32 platform-specific implementations of some nfoGenBIO.h functions

    nfoGenRands.c
        Program to produce 2,867,200 Random Numbers with a Specified
        Generator.  The generator inclusion is accomplished with a
        customization of nfoGenRands.h.

    nfoGenRands.h
        "Template" header file for incorporating an RNG in a manner for
        generating sets of random number via nfoGenRands.c for diehard-style
        testing.

    combo.h
        Header-only file for the Marsaglia COMBO RNG

NOTES AND TODO

   * Make simple cases for generating fixed values and also data from some
     known software RNGs.

   * Work variations on binary output, ASCII format, and also possibly
     base64 encoding of files.  My suspicion is that these operations are
     input-output bound and better encoding will work just fine.

   * Use the VCrayApp model for kit development here.

   * I am thinking about having three flavors of output, ASCII hex values,
     ASCII base64 values, and pure binary.  The ASCII hex would be the
     default.  I want performance comparisons between the 3 cases to see
     what the differences might be.

   * nfoGenAIO.c should have nfoGenAIO_read() optimized for the the case
     of data sets produced by nfoGenAIO_write().

   * nfoGenAIO needs an nfoGenAIO_reset() to allow optional change of
     FILE* fp, resetting of the nfoGenAIO_read buffer.  Clearing of any
     clearing any input-output error/EOF state must be done by the user,
     however.

   * nfoGenAIO_read() should be factored to perform best in favor of the
     default format created with nfoGenAIO_write.

   * nfoGenBIO.h needs an nfoGenBIO-Win32.c to deal with opening of a
     temporary file in the current working directory (typically where the
     .exe is on my PC).  The idea is to have the files be on a SSD and be
     where there is much room for development and data purposes.  So
     particularly where DieHard (or DieQuick) are operated.  It looks like
     this is platform specific.

   * So the temp creation might need to be optional.  The application can
     be built to always supply the FILE* to use.

   * Have to rationalize this with the consumption of BIO files in RNG
     assessments as well.  How the RNG test set will learn of and use the
     appropriate file.

   * I wonder if the consumer should specify where the test file should be
     produced.  It's late and I think I will come at this more clear-headed.
