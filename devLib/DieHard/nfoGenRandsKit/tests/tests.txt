                       NFOGENRANDSKIT CONFIRMATION TESTS
                       =================================

    Demonstrable tests and examples of constructions and operation with
    nfoGenRandsKit customizations are developed to confirm proper operation
    of the kit and also demonstrate how customizations are made for some
    chosen cases of generators.

    The source codes being tested (as opposed to the tests themselves) are
    in the ../dev folder.

MANIFEST

        customizations and confirmation of output when possible.

NOTES AND TODO

   * Work variations on kit output options: ASCII format (default), and also
     possibly base64 encoding and pur binary output.  My suspision is that
     these operations are input-output bound and better encoding will work
     just fine.  ASCII default is to have something readable where particular
     values can be checked.

   * Although nfoGenAIO_read( ) has been confirmed with correct inputs,
     the detecting and handling of defects in the input has not been
     exercised.
