                       NFOGENRANDSKIT CONFIRMATION TESTS
                       =================================

    Demonstrable tests and examples of constructions and operation with
    nfoGenRandsKit customizations are developed to confirm proper operation
    of the kit and also demonstrate how customizations are made for some
    chosen cases of generators.

        customizations and confirmation of output when possible.

NOTES AND TODO

   * Make simple cases for generating fixed values and also data from some
     known software RNGs.

   * Work variations on kit output options: ASCII format (default), and also
     possibly base64 encoding and pur binary output.  My suspision is that
     these operations are input-output bound and better encoding will work
     just fine.  ASCII default is to have something readable where particular
     values can be checked.
