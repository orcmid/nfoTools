                       NFOGENRANDSKIT CONFIRMATION TESTS
                       =================================

    Demonstrable tests and examples of constructions and operation with
    nfoGenRandsKit customizations are developed to confirm proper operation
    of the kit and also demonstrate how customizations are made for some
    chosen cases of generators.

    The source codes being tested (as opposed to the tests themselves) are
    in the ../dev folder.

MANIFEST

    tests.txt
        This description file on tests for proper operation of nfoGenRands
        customizations and confirmation of output when possible.

    test.code-workspace
        File for Visual Studio Code

    mkGenAIO-test1.bat
        Script for compiling nfoGenAIO-test1.c with VC/C++ CL.exe
    nfoGenAIO-test1.c
        nfoGenAIO_write( ) function test
    nfoGenAIO-0.2.1-test1-success-2025-12-03-png
        Output of successful nfoGenAIO-test1

    test1.txt
        Correct output from test1 used as input to test2
    test2.txt
        A still-correct version of test1 with many of the nfoGenAIO_read( )
        allowances also exploited

    mkGenAIO-test2.bat
        Script for compiling nfoGenAIO-test2.c with VC/C++ CL.exe
    nfoGenAIO-test2.c
        nfoGenAIO_read( ) function test
    nfoGenAIO-0.2.1-test2-success-2025-12-04-1905.png
    nfoGenAIO-0.3.0-test2-read-success-2025-12-11-1516.png
       Output of successful nfoGenAIO-test2 with test2.txt input

    mkGenTemps.bat
        Script for compiling nfoGenBIO-win32-temps.c to GenTemps.exe
    nfoGenBIO-win32-temps.c
        Program to exercise the naming, location, and creation of temp files
        on Win32
    GenTemps-0.1.0-success-2025-12-17-1551.png
        Build and successful operation of nfoGenBIO-win32-temps.c 0.1.0

    VCoptions.opt
        @VCoptions.opt options for CL.exe VC/C++ x64 compiles, used by the
        mkGen*.bat scripts

    .vscode
        folder of configuration information for VS Code

    grt/
        Folder for (usually-transient) temporary files under test
        This will end up being used for generated RNG test files for their
        testing, as well as tests of the software.  I'll just have to deal
        with that.

        NOTE: Test (result) files with no extension are excluded from Git.

NOTES AND TODO

   * Work variations on kit output options: ASCII format (default), and also
     possibly base64 encoding and pur binary output.  My suspision is that
     these operations are input-output bound and better encoding will work
     just fine.  ASCII default is to have something readable where particular
     values can be checked.

   * Although nfoGenAIO_read( ) has been confirmed with correct inputs,
     the detecting and handling of defects in the input has not been
     exercised.
