               NFOFLIP: TRANSPOSED CB_FLIP DEVELOPMENT MATERIALS
               -------------------------------------------------

        <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/devLib/Knuth/nfoFlip/dev/>

    nfoFlip is a generator of pseudo-random numbers modelled after the
    Stanford GraphBase (SGB) GB_FLIP program, one of the four kernel
    programs of the SGB system.  nfoFlip is separated and refactored
    for general use as well as with other SGB materials and derivatives.

    This folder is where the materials of a release are developed and
    tested, followed by packaging in a distribution.

    MANIFEST

    dev.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file

    nfoFlip.c
        C Language code for the nfoFlip functions and data that provide a
        lax-Fibonacci deterministic pseudo-random number generator for use
        in SGB-based programs and and others

    nfoFlip.h
        C Language header needed in programs that include use of nfoFlip

    testFlip.c
        C Language program for verifying correct operation of nfoFlip.c

    NOTICE.txt
        Notice of license and permissions applicable to the nfoFlip code.

    This is a working folder.  In the process of development and testing,
    ephemeral materials will be produced here.  They are excluded from the
    GitHub repository.
