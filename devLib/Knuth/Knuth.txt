           DEVLIB KNUTH ALGORITHMS, UTILITIES AND TOOLS COLLECTION
           =======================================================

    This portion of devLib is for the development of programs based on
    the work and contributions of Donald E. Knuth, including in volumes of
    The Art of Computer Programming (TAoCP) as well as many other sources,
    including the Stanford GraphBase (SGB).

    The main focus is development on and for the Microsoft Windows platform.
    Other platforms and construction cases will be entertained, and many of
    the programs are written in portable Clean C.

MANIFEST

    Knuth.txt
       This description file on organization of this section of devLib.

    nfoFlip/
       Development of pseudo-random number generator that is completely
       compatible with GB_FLIP in the Stanford GraphBase

    SGB/
       An OPTIONAL fork of the Stanford GraphBase *excluded* from the nfoTools
       repository, used for reference in development of devLib. Any direct
       dependencies on SGB files will be copied and checked-in where they
       are used with appropriate attribution.

       The SGB repository fork is used intact as a literal copy of Andreas
       Scherer's preservation of SGB at <https://github.com/ascherer/sgb>.
       It is also used to track any updates/patches to the official SGB files.

NOTES AND TODO

  * Complete the initial structure down through the nfoFlip project.

  * Port SGB GB_SORT for an efficient sorting routine

  * Port SGB GB_IO for reading graph description *.dat files

  * Port SGB GB_GRAPH for the common subroutines and data structurs that
    support the conventions of the Stanford GraphBase (SGB).

  * Develop Hashing Functions that support the Miser Project implementation
    of ob-cell HashFlag design.  This will involve ways to test the hashing
    procedures for reliable behavior, with no degradation and minimal
    collisions.  I am looking for whatever help I can find in SGB and in
    The Art of Computer Programming (TAoCP).
