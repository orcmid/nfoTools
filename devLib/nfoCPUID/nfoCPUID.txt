                     nfoCPUID: DETECTING PROCESSOR FEATURES
                     ======================================

    A utility function to determine features of the CPU on which a program
    is running.  CPUID is the name of the processor instruction that
    reports processor features to running programs.

    A key purpose is to determine the presence or absence of special features
    on which a program may depend.  If a program requires a special feature,
    using nfoCPUID will help determine if requirements are not satisfied
    and whether any remediation is available.  If an unavailable feature is
    essential, there should be user-understandable explanation that the
    program cannot operate and employment of the particular processor is not
    supported.

NOTES AND TODO

  * From <https://benlevinson.com/projects/systemInfo> we get that the
    Hardware cpuid instruction (in assembler) returns 4 32-bit words from
    registers.

  * From <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/intrinsics/cpuid-cpuidex>
    we get MSVC-170 description of the two functions __cpuid() and
    __cpuidEx().  The first parameter is an int cpuInfo[4], the second is
    an int function_id, and, for __cpuidex, an int subfunction_id.  These
    are "intrinsics" and the header file is <intrin.h> on Windows.  The
    example is inscrutible C++.  The details are in reference manuals from
    Intel and AMD.
