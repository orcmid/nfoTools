                   nfoCPUID LIBRARY ROUTINES CONFIRMATION TESTS
                   ============================================

    Demonstrable tests and examples of constructions and operation with
    nfoCPUID modules are developed to confirm proper operation of the code.

MANIFEST

    tests.txt
        This description file on tests for proper operation of nfoCPUID
        modules and demonstration releases

   InstructionSet.cpp
        The Microsoft Learn program to provide a print-out of CPUID results.
        This is the source for which a Clean C counterpart is derived to
        demonstrate that the features are accessed successfully. The code is
        from <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/intrinsics/cpuid-cpuidex>.

    Astraendo2-InstructionSet.txt
        Result of executing compiled InstructionSet.exe on Astraend2, a PC
        with the identifed Intel CPU chip version

    Ignored Files
        There are additional files in the working set that are ignored in the
        GitHub repository.  These are any *.obj and *.exe files created as
        parts of testing, and an `x64 CMD VS2022` shortcut that launches
        a Visual Studio x64 Development session with tests/ as the "home"
        location.

NOTES AND TODO

   * Find descriptions of the features that make understanding them and
     exploiting them as understandable as possible.

   * The VC/C++ intrinsics are described at
     <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/intrinsics/compiler-intrinsics>.
     Understanding of these requires examination of platform-provider
     documentation.

   * VC/C++ compiler option /Oi permits the compiler and optimizer to use
     intrinsics for many common functions, including ones in the `math.h`
     library.  An important feature of using intrinsics is that the
     optimizer can work with them in ways not available when a function is
     called.
