               NFOFLIP: TRANSPOSED CB_FLIP DEVELOPMENT MATERIALS
               -------------------------------------------------

        <https://github.com/orcmid/nfoTools/devLib/DEK/nfoFlip/dev/>

    nfoFlip is a generator of pseudo-random numbers modelled after the
    Stanford GraphBase (SGB) GB_FLIP program, one of the four kernel
    programs of the SGB system.  nfoFlip is separated and refactored
    for general use as well as with other SGB materials and derivatives.

    This folder is where the materials of a release are developed and
    tested, followed by packaging in a distribution.

    MANIFEST

    dev.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file

    nfoFlip.c
        C Language code for the nfoFlip functions and data that provide a
        lax-Fibonacci deterministic pseudo-random number generator for use
        in SGB-based programs and and others

    nfoFlip.h
        C Language header needed in programs that include use of nfoFlip

    testFlip.c
        C Language program for verifying correct operation of nfoFlip.c

    NOTICE.txt
        Notice of license and permissions applicable to the nfoFlip code.

    CHANGES-0.0.0.txt
        Boilerplate for changes in distributions after the first one

    This is a working folder.  In the process of development and testing,
    ephemeral materials will be produced here.  They are excluded from the
    GitHub repository.

NOTES AND TODO

  * Add a small batch file for compiling testFlip.

  * At this level develop nfoFlip-1.0.0.txt and packaging as well as
    authentication materials.

  * Create an app to do timing of nfoFlip with a large number of generations.
    Do the same for nfoUniformFlip

  * Consider adding B-suffixed nfoNextFlipB and nfoUniformFlipB for versions
    that don't have the birthday separation problem.

  * Find the differences between timings of the B-suffixed and non-suffixed
    versions.

  * There needs to be an account of the theory behind CB_FLIP and likewise
    the B-suffixed versions, accounted for in the CB_FLIP Literate Program
    and the account in TAoCP v.2 section on the end of random number treat-
    ment and related exercises.

  * The public functions need to be consistently named all beginning with
    nfoFlip.

  * Confirm that the URLs given for this repository file work.

  * Figure out where the distribution of nfoFlip 1.0.0 will be provided.

  * Decide how much of the distribution-included files will be digitally
    signed.
