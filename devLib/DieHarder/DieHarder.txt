           DIEHARDER RANDOM GENERATOR TESTS AND REFERENCE MATERIALS
           ========================================================

    Dieharder is a random number generator (rng) testing suite. ...
    Perfect random number generators produce "unlikely" sequences of random
    numbers -- at exactly the right average rate. Testing a rng is therefore
    quite subtle.

MANIFEST

    DieHarder.txt
        This description file on organization of the archive and use of its
        materials.

    dieharder.pdf
        dieharder manual published by Reini Urban on the GitHub Pages at
        <https://rurban.github.io/dieharder/manual/dieharder.pdf>. That work
        is a fork of Jochen Voss's <https://github.com/seehuhn/dieharder>.

    dieharder-rgb/
       This separately-cloned folder is for a fork of the GitHub repository
       eddelbuettel/dieharder-rgb maintained by Dirk Eddelbuettel on GitHub.
       It appears to be more current than the dieharder-3.31.1.tgz.
          Note: a later version of dieharder supported by Dirk Eddelbuettel
       is at <https://github.com/eddelbuettel/dieharder>.  The ChangeLog file
       is unchanged but there have been 20 merged changes.  For nfoTools
       purposes there appears no reason for concern at this time.

    dieharder-3.31.1.tgz
       compressed tar file of the dieharder-3.31.1 release files
